Focusing on the humanity in everyone you meet cab defuse a bad situation, build a bridge between enemies, repair a broken relationship, etc. Finding the courage to admit that you're wrong and being big enough to apologize can work wonders. Kindness is key. /  / Fairness is a close second. Everyone deserves an equal chance, no one should be excluded from the chance to succeed and thrive. Simple things like not cutting in line, not stiffing the waiter on a tip, telling the cashier who gave you too much money back, are important ways to keep things ""even"" and fair.

150635,4,3,2,GuidingValues,"To me it is important to not inherit bad karma, but take care of myself enough to not be stepped on by others.  I realize that I am not mature enough to fully allow myself to let go of the illusions and barriers I self create for myself.  For this reason, I am not ready to be walked all over and am working hard to maintain peace within my external and internal environment to achieve good karmic status, without letting myself get walked on by others.  I still have to survive and take care of my physical self, and right now that is a primary goal so I can closer focus on more spiritual leanings.  I try not to value anything in particular too hard, or else I fear that I will get caught in a trap that keeps me from reaching the ultimate source of truth.  This ultimate source of truth is without judgement or discernment and seeing things for how they truly are without distinguishing.  This is very difficult to do, but it is a practice nonetheless.  I'm starting to unlock things that I am not quite ready to handle, but at the same time, my life is very interesting and I am not afraid of what happens in it, or at least I'd like to think that.  That being said, there are still some values I find more pleasing than others based on my personality archetype regardless of how detached from that I should be.  I value creativity, open-mindedness and intelligence in the second highest regard.  Humility and gentleness are also valued, but I don't beleive in being a pushover because I see Darwinism as an equally plausible possibility.  Overall I am very confused because I see so many angles, but I know that it is not my intention to hurt anybody and if people valued what I value this world might be a much more evolved place, as ego-centric as that sounds.

I work at a local grocery store and stock shelves with food products.  I get a 30 minute lunch, which I usually spend going to Subway, McDonald's or Arbys.  All three taste very good.  I then finish working at six.  I did the same thing Friday and Saturday with the same hours.  Saturday night I decided to grab me a six pack of beer before heading home to a lonely night with myself.

Another principle that my parents stressed was fulfilling your obligations. If you promised someone or committed to something you had to stick it out to the end because other people were depending on you and you couldn't let them down. So, it was always very important to weigh your actions before you said or did anything because you needed to be sure this was something you could do. Honesty was also very important. People make mistakes and accidents happen but you always needed to be honest about them. If you lied you got into more trouble while growing up than if you owned up to what happened. Being honest isn't always easy but it was important that you learned to take responsibility for your actions and learn to face up and deal with any issues that you caused. My parents weren't religious but taught us that being a good, honest and trustworthy person was what was important in life. If you treated others as you wanted to be treated then you weren't going to make too many wrong decisions or do too many bad things.

My mom and I watched the game together after I put in a full day of working online. My brothers were in and out during the game working on getting the cooler serviced for the upcoming hot weather. On Friday, I got up and went right to work after grabbing a doughnut for breakfast and making a pitcher of sweet iced tea. I took a shower, brushed my hair and worked. I watched the game again with my mom while we had pizza for dinner. On Saturday, I did more work, did a load of laundry and watched the game. I read for several hours after baseball and feel asleep. On Sunday, I watched the finale to the Giants-Dodgers and had chicken and rice for dinner. It was Mother's Day so we had a mini-mom celebration and she cut her finger which had us running around taking care of that. On Monday, we had chicken sandwiches for dinner while I worked and waited for the Giants to open up a home stand with the Atlanta Braves. It was Timmy day, he's my favorite pitcher and he pitched a great game with 11 strike outs and the Giants won. We had tuna sandwiches for dinner and doctored the dogs ears. Tuesday I changed the sheets on my bed, worked online and made a grocery list for my brother when he went downtown. Watched the Giants game was disappointed that they lost. I read until I got sleepy and fell asleep to ESPN on my tv. On Wednesday, it was a day-game with the Braves and the Giants won to take the series.

I fell asleep afterwards while my husband watched the kids. We watched Helix that night, it's getting good. On Sunday, it was Leo's actual birthday, so I made him pancakes as requested, and I found out my mom was alone on Mother's day, so we stopped by to celebrate at her house. She was able to give Leo her birthday gift, which he loved, and it was Skylanders swap force video game, so when we got back to the house I rested and they played, until it was evening when we went to IHOP with my husband's parents, and gave my mother-in-law yellow flowers and she gave Leo his birthday gift.

I think people are inheritaly good and bad or painful experiences turn people into mean, unrespectful, individuals who don't take care of themselves or others around them.

I bought 2 lbs of dried kidney beans, threw them all in and added water.  Then, I cooked them for 3+ hours and they turned out perfect.  Then, I got some plastice containers and froze most all the beans in the freezer to use later.  I got about 3.5 lbs. of cooked beans for a total of $2.20, what a frick'n bargain!!  My poor dog caught mange and started biting and itching 24/7 until she started to bleed.  I went to the pet store and got some Amitraz for the outside  and Ivermectin to give her shots.  After about  a week she's started to get better, but now she has a yeast infection on her skin so she's losing all her hair and smells like cheese, yuk.  Now I'm washing her daily with lemon juice to kill the yeast infection, her hair is still falling out and he looks horrible.

At the core to these values is love, which I believe to be the most powerful force in the Universe except for God. If you're acting out of love, it's rare that you'll act in a way that's immoral or in a way that could harm others. It is love that enables us to engage in self sacrifice, and love that gives us a reason to live, even more so than our work passions and hopes and dreams give us. Along with love is kindness. I believe that in nearly every situation, we can pause and make a choice to act out of love, kindness, integrity and doing the right thing or not. Even when we're angry, sad or depressed. It amazes me sometimes how people make choices to be cruel and how some are capable of acts which are evil, because it seems to me that they could stop and think and make the choice to go in the other direction by acting out of kindness, love and righteousness.",v,205,41.16,37.26,83.17,73.61,25.63,12.2,89.27,73.17,62.44,17.56,8.78,4.39,2.93,0.98,0,0.49,8.78,15.61,6.83,0,15.12,10.73,3.41,9.27,0.49,17.07,6.34,2.93,6.83,2.93,1.95,1.95,19.51,0.49,19.02,5.85,5.37,2.93,3.9,0,5.37,0,10.73,6.83,3.41,6.83,4.39,1.95,0,0.98,0.98,0,15.12,9.27,1.95,0,0.49,2.44,0,5.85,0,0,0,0

197364,6,2,4,GuidingValues,"My most important value, considering that I study psychology and want to eventually be a therapist, is that you should never judge a person for any behavior. There is always room for change, and often times a less than desirable behavior can be treated and reversed. A person may be an ""asshole,"" but we really can't judge them because they are probably dealing with internal struggles that are being untreated. I believe everyone can change. I used to be an incredibly depressed person who had attempted suicide three times. Now I'm sitting here, acknowledging my past, and I know that I will never go back to those feelings. If I can change, anyone can. In psychology, one of the first things you learn about is the fundamental attribution error. Essentially this means that one's behavior cannot be attributed to a single, or fundamental, cause. When interacting with others, I always keep this in mind. If someone is rude to me at my place of work (retail), I may first curse at them in my own head, but then I stand back and consider what their home life must be like. Maybe they're going through a divorce, maybe they've just been laid off from work, or maybe they're just having a general bad day. I don't judge people.

I am also a full time student seeking a Bachelors in Elementary Education. Part of the reason I choose this is so that I will not only be able to provide better for my family, but the schedule would also allow me to be there more for my family. For me, without my family I am almost nothing. I work on myself and take care of my needs not just for myself, but also with my family in mind. I try my best to be honest in all that I do, however there are times where I lie or stretch the truth in the interest of achieving a particular end result. I work very hard in all that I do. When I am given or set a goal for my life I do not give up easily. It is important for me to achieve the goal even if it requires very long and hard work. I want to set a good example for my children through my hard work in life. While money is important, it is not everything. You do need some money to survive and to afford some of the creature comforts of life. Being a mom of two and a full time student we are extremely poor. There are times when I worry that we will not even be able to afford our necessities. However, this rough time is temporary because I know and have faith that the things that I'm currently working on in my life will pan out for the best in the long run. Because of all of my hard work now my children will be provided for and will be given advantages to help them to succeed.

203131,4,2,2,Behaviors7days,"For the past week I have been doing my best to figure out how to help my family overcome our current financial crisis. I typically wake up around 6am when my 4 month old daughter awakes. The first thing I do is give her some cuddles to help her wake up not so fussy and I change her diaper. Then I place her in her swing while I have my morning caffeine for a few minutes. Then I make her her bottle and enjoy the quiet time with her. After she is finished I then begin working on whatever the priority is for that day. My fiancee works full time at a security company and typically leaves in the morning before we wake up. However due to his unemployment before he got that job we are playing catch up with bills and praying we get the money before things get turned off. With two small children (4 months old and 3 years old) it is difficult for me to work outside of the home. According to the math and research I've done I would bring home a max of $80 a week after paying for daycare expenses, gas, and other misc expenses needed for working outside of the home. This is why I choose to work on MTURK and do other online work as I can find it to try and bring in what I can to contribute to the bills. Typically I will work on MTURK until my son wakes up around 830/9am. Then I take a break and have breakfast with my son while watching an educational cartoon of his choice. Then I work for about another hour. Depending on the weather I may take my son outside for about an hour of outside play time or we stay inside and find an activity. After that I do bath time for both of my kids, and then lunch. After lunch I work online for another hour or two before putting the kids down for a nap. I may juggle necessary phone calls during my son's play time depending on the day. During my kids nap time I handle household chores for about an hour and the rest of the time is spent working. After their nap I get him settle with a snack and an activity while I try to squeeze in a little more work before I start cooking dinner. About that time my fiancee gets home from work and we catch up on our day while cooking dinner. After dinner is when I typically take my shower. Then I try to spend at least an hour relaxing with my fiancee before he goes to bed. Because of my daughters current sleep schedule me and her typically will stay up for another hour or two. Depending on how she is I will either focus my complete attention on her, or will put her in her swing or set her next to me while I try to get some more work done. Once she finally falls asleep for the evening I might work for another hour and then wrap things up to get myself in bed. I don't make much for the amount of work that I do on MTURK, but it is definitely more than I would make trying to work outside of the home and pay for daycare for two small children. Plus it allows me to be with my children more and ensure that they are raised with the values I find important. Lately we have not had the money to do much aside from work. I know this will come to an end as soon as school starts back in the fall and I receive my loan money which will pay for their daycare while I am in class and student teaching. This time next year I will be graduated and hopefully have a full time teaching job that will allow me the freedom to have a little more down time with my family.",v,671,57.23,24.88,97.29,42.3,21.65,12.52,85.39,74.81,61.1,17.59,14.01,9.24,1.19,0,3.13,0.45,3.58,16.69,5.81,1.94,18.48,7,3.58,9.84,0.45,14.31,5.96,7,6.56,2.68,3.58,0.3,9.54,0,9.39,1.49,1.94,1.64,2.53,0.15,2.83,0,2.09,1.79,0.3,0.45,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,10.43,1.79,0.45,0,0,0,0.15,8.49,3.13,0.45,3.13,1.34

Until I lost my job recently, I have always been independent-minded.  Also though, I believe in honesty. I don't want to befriend or work for people who are liars and cheats. If I find out they are, I lose all respect for them. I still believe you can get along in this world without having to cheat at it.  I have never valued expensive things or lusted after them. We were ""thrift shop"" raised because my Father died when I was 5, so my mother went out to work and didn't make much. I never was into jewelry or clothes that much. still am not.  I have never been into fine cars or even fine dining for that matter!  To me, rich people aren't any happier...they just worry more about their money!

Let's see, during this week I did several mundane chores like making beds, cleaning bathrooms, doing laundry, making meals etc. A few of the extra things I did involved getting the pool ready for the summer. I cleaned it very well, adjusted chemicals, made sure pump was working correctly and filters were working well. Also, my mother and I went to buy plants and we came home and planted them, so watering has become a daily chore. My brother came down for a 2 day visit and helped us do several things that we need a man to do, a tall man!  He changed light bulbs we can't reach, spread mulch for us etc. It's always good to see him, and he enjoys the pool when he's here. Most every day I look for work on various websites. I am looking for something part-time I can do at home.  Mturk doesn't pay me enough money, but I try to work on it every day for awhile. But I really need a better job. I'm receiving Social Security so my plight is not dire, but if something happened to my brother or mother, I couldn't afford to live here any more.  I had worked for over 23 years at home doing data analysis for a marketing company. But now they are trying to make everything automatic, that a computer can do, so they do not need their data analysts any longer. Bummer. I thought I would have that job my whole life and would keel over doing it, but not to be.  So, now I must  look for work again at age 61.  Like anyone would want to hire a 61 year old! There just aren't enough jobs to go around.  But, I digress. My mother and I don't go out much to entertaining types of things, but we do subscribe to Netflix and stream movies. If we really want to see something newer, I go down to the Redbox and pick out a movie. My mother just moved in with me last fall after her husband died. I am so happy to have her here!  We are getting along pretty well....as I thought we would. However, when she moved in I had just been diagnosed with  breast cancer and she went through the surgery with me and then I just started getting every bug that came along...my resistance was so low from the radiation treatments.  Several colds, bronchitis, on and on, and I think she just started to get bummed out that I was sick all the time.  She had just nursed a dying husband, so she was sick of people being sick.

237658,3,3,3,GuidingValues,"One of my most important values is veganism. I believe that animals should not be treated like they are ""less"" than humans, and that speciesism is one of the only motivating forces for the way people treat animals. I do not eat meat, dairy, eggs, honey, or refined sugar. I also do not wear animal products and yes, that includes leather. I think it is important to be as aware as possible about the consequences your actions might have for others and to be sensitive and caring about those consequences. Because of that, I am against animal testing. I have seen photos of some of the horrible things done to animals for experiments (many of which are not all that necessary) and can hardly understand why my species does these things.  /  / Another value of mine is that I am pro-LGBT rights. That means I do not think that who you are attracted to or how you identify your gender should affect how you're treated or what rights you have. While it is a privilege to be in the majority, I feel that it is wrong to make life harder for those who are not. /  / I also am very critical of psychiatry. I find that the current model of ""healing"" for survivors of sexual abuse or any kind of torture/trauma/etc takes responsibility off the abusers/criminals/terrorists/etc who caused the person's traumatic event to happen in the first place, and places it solely on some nebulous enemy called ""mental illness"" that it makes no sense to be angry with. While I understand that being angry is hard and painful, I think we need to be upset about the fact that rape/torture/sexual violence/assault/ritual abuse/etc are such widespread problems in our culture. I also dislike the way that literally everything is considered an illness. Even having a really disagreeable personality makes you ""sick"" according to psychiatry. In many cases, psychiatry legislates morality. If you are asexual and do not believe sex is important, you have hypoactive sexual disorder. If you believe in magic or the occult ie: spiritual things ""normal"" people don't believe in, you risk being labeled as delusional. It gets difficult to draw the line between labeling to help people and labeling to enforce social normativity.  /  / I believe in rights for disabled people and understanding for their needs.

So far, I am only trained to handle burglary alarms - I will learn fire alarms, medical alarms, and storm-related alarms later when I am more used to the system. When people's burglary alarms go off, I call them to make sure things are okay and call the police if things are not okay. In the past seven days, I had my first weekend in three weeks. I had to trade my ""weekend"" (ie: Fridays and Saturdays off) to have certain days off for class and got very busy and stressed out.  /  / On Monday and Tuesday, the 16th and 17th, I went to work. On both days, I believe I drove myself in my new Hyundai Sonata, which is light blue. My schedule is 7:00 to 3:30 so on both of those days I had to get up at 5:30 in the morning. It has been very exhausting and I have not been sleeping particularly well lately. On Wednesday, I went to work and afterward went to an Illustration class where I worked on making collages in photoshop. On Thursday I worked again, then I had Friday and Saturday off. On Thursday, I believe it was Thursday anyway, I went swimming at the community pool with a friend and then we made cake for another friend's birthday. The cake was vanilla with chocolate frosting. On Friday, I went to see my doctor to get a prescription updated and the amount increased. Then I went to Target to fill the prescription because Target is cheaper than Walgreens where I used to go. On Saturday I saw a friend from my old job. I drove my Sonata down to an outdoor mall where I met her and read her Tarot cards. She told me what happened at my old job after I left which was interesting. I looked at jewelry but did not buy anything because I did not have very much money on hand.

I make sure my house is clean and inviting just in case they want to come by or have friends at my house. I also make sure that they are fed, clothed, clean, and most importantly, HAPPY every day of my life. It is crucial to me that when they are older, they look back and say that they were happy. They want for nothing and enjoy life to the most possible capacity. I sometimes suffer, but, they won't have to as long as I am around. I am also guided by the principle of the quote, ""cleanliness is close to Godliness"". I clean everything in my house every day and will do so until I am dead. Even if I get an actual job and no longer work at home on the computer, I will continue to keep my house immaculate. I do this because it is a very important part of childhood to be able to enjoy a stress free, clutter free, and healthy home. If I were to wake up one day and find myself unable to do the things that I do around the house I would immediately call a health professional to fix it. I feel that strongly about it.

Forgiveness is also very important to me, as I think that when one holds onto anger, it is damaging for both self and others. Forgiveness does not mean condoning ones behavior.

Further that our physical sense are like a radio set, they only have certain channels we can experience life but around us if we use our inner gifts like intuition, inner vision or inner feeling we can begin to detect an energy field around us that has life - that has beings who live on this energy field which is alive with consciousness. And I believe as we continue onward into our future the door or entry to these other dimensions is getting smaller and smaller. Further, when we sleep and our waking consciousness goes to sleep, we join this other part of us which exists on other dimensions and we have experiences there which when we awaken into this physical world we may remember as a strange dream or not at all. I have had so many experiences of this contact with the spiritual part of ourself, that I do not believe this is true, I know it. And furthermore, Creator is all of us, and we are Creator or we are all one - that means every other person is a part of me and I am a part of them which is why to some degree when I meet other people I can feel a sense of who they are without any words - so how this knowingness affects me is that I can alone everyone else to be who they are, whether I like them or not, their soul has choosen the earthly personality to go though lessons of life and I must respect it.

It's very easy to know what the best decision is at every given moment. We live in a world though that for the most part someone else has tried to instill their values into us. So when we make decisions based on what is right or wrong it's usually done from a platform that we did not create ourselves. Some could say that altruism does not exist. Isn't self fulfillment easier than any kind? But how long do we stay satiated from that action? / Good things can come from self fulfilling actions, but ultimately I truly believe that each and every creature on this planet has been created for a certain purpose, and ultimately that purpose derives around serving others. It's very hard for myself to fulfill my need because I love to control everything, or at least have the impression that I have the control. The irony is that there really is little that we have even a semblance of control over. I am moved by actions of people that act out of dignity no more really though than I am by the actions of people that are atrocious. Adolf Hitler intrigues me as much as Mother Teresa. Mimicking Mother Teresa would actually be much harder though because it would be taking the moral high ground, something that produces more fulfillment than any other act. Unfortunately my basic values were not embedded into me as much as they should have as a child, but  I also believe that as an adult now I have absolutely every opportunity, tool, resource, and enough abundance to provide a great life for myself and as many others as I would like to provide for.

It's nearly healed up, though. For creative activity, I write, not that you can tell from this stream of consciousness example. I'm working on a novel and a bunch of short stories, and when I'm done I will share them with the world and hopefully people will respond to them. I just want to be noticed for doing the things I enjoy. I like to travel but that costs money. Seeing the world and meeting different kinds of people makes me happy.

I try to practice respect to everyone, no matter what the other person says, does, looks like or anything else. Respect is something that is overlooked a lot of times. I believe to have respect for others is something we could all do a little more of. I also believe in forgiveness, this can be challenging, but in the end it saves a lot of stress and hard feelings. I also feel it is of utmost importance to protect plant and animal life, and the earth in general. I know that's a touchy issue, but I feel a strong sense of commitment to the natural world. I do not drive, and this is possible because I work from home and live in town, so anywhere I need to go I bike or walk. I also save power when I can, I try not to be wasteful. I volunteer by cleaning up trails, cleaning litter. I recycle on the regular. I try to teach my son how important all of these things are, and that it can be said it is a human duty to protect and respect the environment. I believe in equality, I think this is a major issue in our country. I think social equality is by far the grossest example of things we need to change. The income in this country is disgustingly distributed. Far too many people in America work so very hard, yet struggle just to get by. It is so sad to me.

Before and after his lessons, I worked on my Transcription job from home. He had a friend come over on Thursday, and they had a great time. At the end of each weekday last week, when my husband came home from work, we had a good time getting outside and enjoying the summer weather. We went for walks and bike rides, and did some yard work. Each weekday last week, I had my son complete a series of worksheets, so that he does not lose any valuable education time during the summer. I had him complete three each day, each of a different subject. He is also required, by me, to read for at least 20 minutes each day. Most of the days, I let him read silently; one day last week, I had him read aloud to me, because this really helps his verbal reading skills. Last weekend, we borrowed a truck and spent most of it in the mountains. We took our mountain bikes up trails, and had such a fun time! We even found a rather large garter snake when we visited a nearby stream. Yesterday, we went for a good long hike. We saw a moose, but our peaceful hike ended up getting ruined by some jerks on four wheelers. Nothing ruins our hikes more than loud engines, and people tearing up the trails. Not to mention, this is illegal on the trails we were on. Anyway, after the four wheelers left, we enjoyed our time in the mountains.

Everyone will make mistakes, that is the only guarantee.  /  / You don't have to understand others, but you do have to be understanding with them. Just because you don't understand or agree with a choice they made doesn't mean that choice is wrong, or that you have a right to judge them for it.

Compassion is key. /  / Personally I view relationships with others as the most important thing, you can be rich and have all of the possessions in the world and if everyone thinks you're an asshole, you will sell be miserable.

Sometimes answers are not as quick as I would like them but eventually I always get an answer and know what I should do.  I believe because of this that any decision big or small can be solved by pray.  It also makes me a kinder and more generous person.

I would always choose family first. Then around 30 I had a breakdown due to abuse I suffered as a child and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. This has caused me to be weakened and reach for a higher power to guide me through. After regularly attending church and studying the bible I began to understand why people say God first. Because if we are focused on God and what he thinks of us, how he loves us and how he wants us to behave we become more God centered. More of Him in us and less of us. That dynamic makes us less self centered and more other focused. This has made me a better wife and mother. When I am feeling crabby or unhappy or upset I try to remember God's desires for me to live a good life and to love others above myself. This often helps me re focus on those around me and forget my needs. Now I'm not saying I neglect my needs in fact in order to be healthy we must care for ourselves first and make sure we are meeting our needs. In order to give we have to be filled up first, since we give from our excess. /  / I think life long learning is important including reading and I have done my best to instill that in my 6 children. Although one is just an infant. I think family has been the guiding factor in my life. I have a BA degree and worked for over 11 years in that field but finally was able to be stay at home mom and that has made all the difference in my life. Although at times I struggle with the thought that I am not contributing to society I have to remind myself that I am building 6 healthy and functional members of society that are going to make a positive impact on the world.  /  / I think honesty, integrity and loyalty are all important. I also believe we have to make a choice in life to be good, that all of us have the ability for evil within us and we must choose the good. My upbringing included all 3 types of abuse but when I became a mom I had to consciously decide not to do what was done to me. And I have done a great job, if I might say so myself. My oldest is starting at Iowa State in the fall, my next two both hold a 3.9 GPA in high school one is an accomplished singer and the other a prized employee at his after school job, understanding the importance of hard work. My middle schooler made honors all 4 quarters and loves softball. My nine year old is extremely creative and was nominated as class rep even though it was her first year at the school.

Honesty, I believe in telling people the truth and expecting the same in return. This especially true with friends and family. I want to be able to trust people and to have that happen they must be honest at all times so I know I can rely on them. I am brutally honest with people too, I don't like lying about the way I feel or something that happened. /  / 2. Caring- I care for a lot of my friends and family when they are in need and I would expect the same with them. To care for people shows you love and support them and that is really important when maintaining relationships. I especially care for my husband and the family he has brought me into. /  / 3. Trusting- there are so many aspects of trust it is hard to go in one directions. But you cannot have anything happy in life without trust. If you can't trust someone you worry all the time and waist prescious life waiting away worrying about the what if's. Being able to trust someone relieves a lot of things in life. /  / 4. Love- Where would we be in life without love, love is what makes me want to wake up and do stuff every day. Without love I would have no reason for living. Love brings happiness and ties into honesty, caring, trust and pretty much everything else in life. /  / 5. Working hard, I think everyone should work hard not only in work sense but also in life. If you want something you must work hard to get it and be willing to show people how much it really means to you by doing everything you can to get it and maintain it.

During the past 7 days I have also been planning a baby shower for my best friend.  I have decided where to have it and what to eat, and I have purchased but not filled out the invitations.  I rearranged my living room this morning because the window was reflecting off of the tv and making it difficult to see the screen.  Today I am watching TV and surfing the internet, as well as doing surveys on mturk.

I work eight hours and then drive home the traffic is usally heavier during the drive home.  When I get home I fix supper then after diner I wash the dishes feed the animals  Then I have just a few hours to watch tv or try to get stuff done around the house.  I usually am very tired and go to be around ten.  During the weekends I do the laudry and clean up the house.  It is a never ending process and sometimes I get very weary of it.  I just keep thinking the hard work will pay off.  ,v,207,63.3,26.92,98.99,26.56,18.82,9.18,82.61,74.88,58.45,15.94,11.11,7.73,3.38,0,0,0,4.83,13.53,7.25,1.45,15.94,5.8,4.35,8.7,0.48,16.91,3.86,4.35,9.18,4.83,4.35,0,6.76,0.97,5.8,0.97,0.48,0.97,1.93,0,1.93,0,2.42,1.45,0.97,0.97,0,0.97,0,0,0,0,7.25,2.42,0.48,0,0,0,1.45,4.35,0.97,0.48,0,0

Happiness can be found in so many places if it is sought, and harmony makes life much more peaceful for all involved.

Money and a 60 hour a week career does not hold a candle to happiness and freedom.

I adore my spouse, friendships, family, and relationships, and they are held in higher esteem for me than material possessions.  Likewise, intelligence and a great sense of humour are more important to me than outward appearances -- there are many people who are beautiful on the outside, but there is often a shortage in those who are beautiful on the inside.

We carpooled home that night, ate dinner out on the deck, and put on some 80s music while we ate and talked.  When we went back inside, we put Evil Dead while my spouse programmed and I worked on some writing I needed to finish.

I tried out a new recipe, and it was surprisingly good!  Then we watched a new horror movie on Netflix, snugged on the sofa, and ate popcorn.  Then we bathed and went to bed. /  / Today we woke up late, which felt amazing, took an early morning shower, and headed to our friend's house for breakfast -- we brought half of the food, he provided the other half.

No matter where we come from or what we are going through, we are all deserving of having someone treat us kindly.  I have often sought out opportunities that allow me to be of service to others, through employment, through volunteerism, through day-to-day interactions.  People don't deserve our pity - they deserve our empathy and support.  I DO NOT believe that this value comes through simply because people consider themselves to be religious. In fact, I have often found that those who consider themselves the most pious are the least likely to lend a hand - unless there's some sort of accolades for their efforts.  I have never found an organized religion that speaks to the complete giving of one's self to other beings.  Vowing to honor and support a god who is not visible in our lives doesn't help humankind.  I extend this courtesy to all living creatures who share our planet - they, too, deserve kindness, compassion and understanding. Hypocritical people infuriate me, as do self-centered and mean-spirited individuals.  I DO believe that karma is real and that these people will eventually get what they've got coming.

Little white lies are acceptable in our society, but sometimes they grow into bigger lies. This got me to thinking about how many times a day we lie. When I began taking note, it was astounding how frequently we are deceitful in one day! /  / The other thing that drives me is that we live in a self-centered world. I discovered that the times I felt most fulfilled have been when I have been reaching out to others. Even when helping others, we become self-absorbed with how ""good"" we are for helping so and so. To be truly self-less is daunting, but do-able. The Bible says that when we help someone, or do something for another person, the left hand should not know what the right hand is doing. Basically, don't toot your own horn. Forget the part you played, instead experience it as part of our life work. See that we are here as part of one body, which has many parts. When we function in our ""call"" it is for the sake of others, not a narcissistic purpose. The Bible also says that when we draw attention to our own good deeds we have already received our reward. It is a very small reward compared to the bigger reward we could have obtained.",v,242,10,66.75,94.35,72.05,15.13,14.46,87.19,76.45,62.81,20.25,11.16,3.31,6.61,0.83,0,0.41,9.09,16.12,6.2,1.24,9.92,11.16,9.92,6.61,1.65,18.6,4.96,7.02,10.74,7.85,2.07,0.83,18.6,0.83,17.77,4.55,2.07,1.24,1.65,1.65,7.02,0.41,4.55,3.72,0.41,1.24,0.83,0,0,0,0,0,13.22,3.72,1.24,0,0,0,1.24,9.09,0,0,0,0

These guiding values are at the core of all of my decisions and how I try to interact with people.  While not strongly religious (I'm agnostic), I do believe in living by the golden rule of treating others the way that you want to be treated.  I believe that all people are equal and that all of us are just doing the best we can to get by in the world and that it's of great importance to make sure to treat others with respect and kindess.  It really doesn't take that much effort to be kind and respectful to the people around you.  What I have discovered is that you tend to get back what you give, so putting more kindness out into the world just brings more kindness back to you.  This is not to say that bad things don't still happen on occasion, but you are far more likely to reap good things if you are good to other people.  And living this way not only makes other people feel better, but it makes you feel better as a person as well.

548381,7,2,3,GuidingValues,"I think one of the most guiding principles that I live by is making sure that whatever decisions I make, whatever I do or say or anything, how that will impact someone else. If it will impact their lives, thoughts, or feelings positively then I think my actions are good. That's a really important value to me: making sure that I am never hurting someone else, even their feelings. Although sometimes I do, both intentionally or unintentionally. But I know that it's wrong and I know as soon as I do it (most of the time) that it's wrong. As long as I am not hurting others, I think I am doing okay. This principle guides my personal and professional lives. In relationships, I make sure to always be there when teh other person needs me. If I turn down a request from a friend to, for example, pick them up when they are stranded because their car broke down, or to help them move, etc. then I will feel really bad becuase my decision NOT to help them will negatively affect them. it will be harmful to our friendship, and they will have to find another course of action to resolve their problems. That's making their life harder which is negatively affecting them. So I always say yes when a friend is in need (within reason of course. I would hate to be ""used!""). I am also NEVER late when meeting with a friend unless I have a good reason. I also will send a message to let them know I'll be late and that I'm sorry. My time is not more valuable than theirs. And it's disrespectful, and thus negative, if I choose to be late. I think the same value can be applied to a greater scale. So long as one person is not affecting another, laws should not be made to restrict that action. Gay marriage, for example. If two men or women want to get married, their actions don't directly OR indirectly affect me in any way. At all. So why legislate against it? The same goes for a ton of other similar situations. Complicated, sure. But a good principle and one that definitely guides my life.

She has always had a tricky tummy so she was most compassionate with my trying to give my tummy a rest. On Sunday was busy with Mass with my roommate followed by another Mass and Baptism with my family before I returned home for a monthly prayer group meeting with six other women.

If you don't learn from your mistakes you will continue to make them and are destined for a very hard road ahead.

They are there because you are able to share with and help them, as well as, they can reciprocate and help you and share with you.  My personal relationships are such that I try to be available when I am needed and be someone who can be relied upon and nurturing.  I love my family and it shows in my actions.  I know my family loves me, because it shows in their actions. /   My prayer life is another guiding  way I am guided through life.  It not only helps me deal with life's difficulties, but gives me peace and tranquility knowing that I have divine help in all aspects of my life.  If I find myself in stressful situations, it is one of the first things I do: turn to God in prayer. /    I find that through the years I have matured about what matters most in my life.  Money and things do not bring happiness.  It is the people in one's life and the presence of a relationship with God that brings one the most joy.  I strive for success in my progress toward holiness and less than success in life's endeavors.

That may not be attainable either but it's more reasonable because there is room for error.  I try to be a better person in how I treat and take care of myself.  I try to evaluate my past and see how can I move foward and/or what are the takeaways from postive/negative events.  I try to treat people with respect.  I really believe in the golden rule which is to treat others how you would want to be treated.  A simple hello, thanks, good morning, good night, or holding the door can really change someone's day.

To have a moderate balance of both technological fun and physical/outdoors fun, ie play some video games and use computers but also fish hunt go outside and have fun.

To live in a world where you can have your own beliefs and not have to like people you don't want to or be told how to live in your own land or town.

True freedom means you can live how you want with who you want on your own land.

Your life is all you got, and you only get it once so you shouldn't have to fill it with shit you do not want to. Enjoying life is making the best out of what you can, and that means your relationships, your ideals, your everything is and should be up to you.

I do not believe in lying or sugar coating anything. I believe that eventually the truth always comes out anyway so there is no point in hiding it. I also believe that it is important to be successful. I am not a person who values high end objects but in order to be comfortable and content in life you really need to be successful. I do not know too many homeless people that are happy and content living on the street. I value the objects that I do have but would like to live comfortably without having to worry about bills. Call me crazy but I like electricity and running water. I also value my family. I am in a line of work where I see people at their absolute lowest every day. When people do not have the love and support of family it makes life very difficult. I am lucky to have a family that loves and supports me and is there when I need them. Spending time with my family alone can help me talk through problems and understand that I do have a good life even when I am struggling.

While she was in class, my sons and I went grocery shopping, and then we went back to pick her up.  We picked up lunch on the way home, stopped at the house so the kids could brush their teeth, and then went to get their teeth cleaned.  After the tooth-cleaning, I took my daughter to the orthodontist.  Then I took my boys to music lessons.  I picked up dinner for my kids from a Pizza Hut Express, then took my older kids to youth group.  While they were there, my youngest son and I went to the bookstore.  When it was time to pick up my older two, we got the, then stopped at Starbuck's for a treat before driving home.  Once home, I got the kids settled in to bed, had a glass of wine, worked on mTUrk for a while, and then brushed my teeth, changed, and went to bed. /  / Thursday morning I woke up, worked out, had breakfast, and then proceeded to make a schoolwork schedule for the kids for that day. (We home school.) Afterward, I responded to some email I had not seen the day before, cleaned out the sink, unloaded and re-loaded the dishwasher, and did a load of laundry.  I woke up my kids, made them breakfast, and showered and dressed. I dried my hair and applied make-up.  At that point, it was time for my kids to begin work, so I started them on their work and then did some mTurk HITs.   After about an hour,it was time to get lunch ready, so I prepared lunch for all of us while emptying the dishwasher and moving laundry from washer to dryer.  We ate lunch, and I read some news stories on-line while doing that.  I checked the mail, and I got my kids back on-task for the afternoon.  While they were working, I took a short nap, and then I folded laundry.  I put the laundry away and emptied the trash.  Then I spoke with my husband on the phone about when he would be home from work.  I read some more email, checked the snail mail, and then began preparing dinner.  The kids and I ate a hurried dinner and then rushed over to my youngest son's karate class.  While he was in class, my older son and daughter and I walked around the neighborhood.  After karate class, we got a snack at McDonald's and then drove home.  I told the kids to get ready for bed and then did some more HITs on mTurk.  I talked to my husband briefly about what he wanted to do for Father's Day, brushed my teeth, put on my pajamas, and went to bed. /  / Friday morning I woke up as usual, worked out, ate breakfast, showered, dressed, dried my hair, applied make-up, and woke up my kids.  We did our usual morning schoolwork, ate lunch after I prepared it, and then went to the pool at a nearby YMCA.  While the kids swam and played, I watched them and sent emails and text messages from my phone to various people regarding school, church, and just catching up.  When the kids were done in the pool, I drove them home and cooked dinner.  After they had eaten, I took them to the store to buy Father's Day cards and gifts for their dad.  Once everyone was satisfied with their choices, we went to the YMCA to work out.  I drove us home, where my husband was waiting for us.  We all watched some TV shows from Netflix.  Then I put the kids to bed, changed in to my pajamas, did some HITs on mTurk, and brushed my teeth before climbing in to bed. /  / Saturday I did my usual morning routine, minus the workout, and then I went to the grocery store.  I spent an hour at Kroger buying enough food for the next week, and then I came home and put the groceries away.  Once that was done, my husband and kids wanted to go to Costco to get some bulk batteries and look for video games, so we drove to the nearest Costco, stopping for lunch at Steak N Shake on the way, and spent another hour there.  I also took my daughter to the shoe store next door to look for shoes, but we were unsuccessful in finding her something.  When we got home, it was time for dinner.  I peeled some potatoes, pre-heated the oven to cook rolls, shucked some corn, and seasoned the steaks that my husband would grill.  While my husband grilled and my kids played outside, I cooked the corn, rolls, and potatoes and opened a bottle of wine to let it breathe.  Once the steaks and sides were done, we sat on the patio and ate dinner.  After we ate, I cleaned up the dishes and put them in the dishwasher while my husband chatted with a neighbor and the kids played outside.  Since it was late when we were done outside, everyone went to bed soon after coming inside. /  / Sunday morning I got up, showered, dressed, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, dried my hair and applied make-up.  Then I got everyone else up so they could get ready for church.  The kids and I all gave my husband his Father's Day gifts and then got in the van to head to church.  We were visiting a new church for the first time, so on the way there, we discussed what we were hoping to find in a new church.  We found the church, parked, and went inside where we talked a little bit with some on the church members.  We discovered that one couple there knew the pastor from our former church, so that was a pleasant surprise.  After the worship service, we chatted a little more with the pastor and his wife, and then we headed to lunch.  My husband chose the nearby Chinese buffet for his Father's Day lunch, so we went there and enjoyed a nice meal.  After we finished there, we drove to a local bakery for dessert.  Then we drove home, where my husband collapsed on the couch for a nap.  The kids and I were bored, so we loaded our swim gear and headed to the YMCA pool for the afternoon.  While the kids swam and played at the pool, I napped and read a book.  Then we headed home.  My husband had had a good nap, so we decided to grill hamburgers and hot dogs for dinner, which we ate while sitting on the patio.  After dinner, we cleaned up our mess.  I let the kids play video games while I did a few HITs on mTurk, and then I told everyone to get ready for bed.  We all went to bed early that night because we were exhausted. /  / Monday morning I awoke at 5:00 am so I would have time to prepare for the day.  I exercised first thing, then showered, dressed and ate breakfast.  After breakfast, I checked email and news, and then I prepared my kids' schoolwork for the week, checking out resources on-line and making lists of what they each needed to accomplish.  At 8:00, I wakened my kids and made them breakfast.  AS soon as they were done eating, we got to work on school.  The work load was light for them, so I did some HITs while they worked.  Everyone was finished for the day before lunch-time, so while I prepared lunch, my daughter cleaned her room, my older son practiced guitar, and my younger son began trying to clean his pocket knife of rust. I poured some vinegar in a bowl for him so he could soak it, and we chatted about an experiment we had done a few months ago that proved that vinegar was a good cleaner.  Once lunch was ready, we all ate quickly so we could run errands in the afternoon.  Our errands included a trip to the mall to buy exercise shoes for my daughter and then to get haircuts for all the kids.  Driving to the mall was a pain because the traffic was all backed up, but once we got there, we enjoyed looking at all the stores.  After looking for shoes in two stores without success, my daughter and I finally found a good pair for her at the third store.  I paid for the shoes, and then my older son asked to look in Radio Shack for a 12-volt battery.  We went to Radio Shack and asked the lady at the counter for the battery, which she gave us.  Then we browsed for a few minutes until everyone was bored.  We left the mall and drove to e nearby Great Clips so the kids could get their hair cut. I checked them in on my phone, drove to the salon, and sat there while they got haircuts.  I paid, making sure to leave a good tip, and then I drove home.  We had a quick dinner of leftovers and decided to give my daughter's new shoes a workout by going to the YMCA. We drove there, used the weight machines and ellipticals for an hour, and then drove home.  When we got home, I sat down to do some HITs while my kids told their dad about their day.  All of a sudden, I heard my youngest son say, ""Ouch!"" I asked what happened, and he showed me that he had cut himself while cleaning his knife.  We cleaned the wound, put ointment and a bandaid on it, and then I called the advice nurse to see if he would need a tetanus shot.  It was a small cut, but I had to spend 30 minutes describing it to the nurse while my husband put the kids to bed.  Finally, the nurse said that my son was due for a tetanus booster anyway, so we made an appointment to have the shot the next morning.  I wondered why she had asked all those questions if he was due for a booster anyway, but I guess she was following protocol.  I went back to doing HITs while sipping a glass of wine.  Then I got cleaned up, changed into pajamas, and got ready for bed. On the way to bed, I threw some clothes in the washer, hoping to remember to dry them in the morning before I left. /  / Tuesday I overslept.  When I finally woke up at 8:30, I immediately got showered, dressed, and ready to go before bolting a quick piece of peanut butter toast for breakfast.  I started my coffee brewing and roused my cranky kids as quickly as I could.  As they dressed, I checked email and the weather forecast,  threw the wet laundry into the dryer and then I tried to do a few HITs.  There was no time for schoolwork before we left, so I rushed the kids into the van and headed to the doctor's office to get my son's tetanus shot.  We got to the facility about 10 minutes early, but we couldn't find the office.  I finally asked a security guard where to go.  He pointed me to the check-in, and we stood in line for 5 minutes waiting our turn.  The lady at the check-in told me that I had a balance from a previous appointment earlier in the month, but I had the receipt with me because I had not cleaned out my purse since then.  We shared a laugh about the benefits of being a slob, and she pointed me to the doctor's office where my son would get his shot.  We got to the waiting area about 2 minutes late, and I was glad it wasn't worse, considering our late start.  While we waited to be called back, we looked at the fish in the aquarium and read the posters about exercising on that were hanging on the wall.  The nurse called my son back, took his vitals, and showed us to the room. The doctor came in, examined the cut, and told us there was nothing to worry about. The nurse came back in to give my son his shot, and I told him to look the other way and take a deep breath, which he did. We left the office, got in the van, and drove to a nearby Chick-fil-A for lunch. After ordering at the drive-through,  I drove back home, tried to get my kids on task for school. and did some more housework--laundry, dishes, sweeping, and cleaning the counters.  Amazingly, my kids worked really well all afternoon, and I checked their work before making dinner.  Dinner was a quick affair, consisting of whatever I could find in the refrigerator.  As soon as we finished eating, it was time for my son's karate class.  I drove him to class and then went to the grocery store with my other two kids.  After shopping, we had a few minutes until my son was done with karate, so my daughter tried to show me how to knit.  I was a miserable failure at it, but we had a good laugh at my efforts.  Then I got my son from class and drove home.  Once home, I kissed my husband hello and made sure he had found something for dinner.  I told my kids to get ready for bed while I did some more HITs.  Finally, I tucked my kids in and got ready for bed myself.  However, I wasn't tired enough to sleep, so I did a few more HITs before finally crawling into bed after midnight. /  / This morning I woke up at 6:00 and made myself some breakfast.  I ate, put on some workout clothes, and exercised for an hour.  I sent some emails to friends and family, and I made plans to get lunch with my good friend in two weeks.  I let my kids sleep as late as they wanted because there was not too much work to do.  They all slept until almost lunchtime, so I went ahead and made lunch for them after they got up.  After we had eaten, I did a few more HITs and made them start schoolwork, but they all finished their work in less than an hour.  I decided to take them to the park, but when I went out to the garage, I saw that my right rear tire had a bubble in it.  I called the tire shop where we had purchased the tires and made an appointment to get them looked at tomorrow.  I called my husband to tell him what was going on, and I told my kids the bad news.  They didn't really care about the park, so we sat around watching TV until dinner time.

647172,6,2,2,Behaviors7days,"The last seven days have been very much out of my routine, as my husband and I recently purchased a travel trailer and moved into it.  Almost all of our activities have centered around solving the problems we have run into with the trailer, which has turned out to need a good deal of repair before it was suitable for my husband to live in.  My husband has end stage renal disease and is on dialysis, which we do at home through peritoneal dialysis.  This means that we must have a sterile area which can be sealed from any contamination, as well as hot water to clean with.  Unfortunately, it turns out the plumbing in the trailer leaks in many places.  Repairing this plumbing has required numerous visits to the hardware store to get the correct parts, then to trade those in for the REAL correct parts.  At the same time, we were moving our possessions from our former rental house to the trailer in a small car, as well as storing many things in a storage building we also rent.  A few possessions had to be given away or sold.  While doing all of this we had to maintain my husband's routine of dialysis every four hours during the day (four exchanges, four hours apart, each lasting about 45 minutes).  My husband also volunteers at a computer lab and it was necessary for him to continue that obligation.   /  / On Thursday we drove the 150 mile round trip to Las Cruces for my husband regular monthly blood tests and clinic visit.  While there we also did our laundry as the laundrymat there is much cheaper than here in Truth or Consequences, and filled the car with gas since gas is also about 25 cents a gallon cheaper there.  We saw my husbands temporary nurse, as they are in the process of hiring a new nurse.  He had blood drawn and we did some continuing education. /  / The whole situation was complicated by the event called Fiesta here in Truth or Consequences, NM over this weekend - Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  This occurred in a park that is midway between the two homes so that we also had to contend with a great deal of traffic, and tourists who are often quite lost.  We did go to Fiesta ourselves on Saturday, walking from the trailer to the park.  We listened to and danced to the band Casual Fridays for about half and hour, then stopped to visit with some other volunteers from the computer lab who were manning a booth.   /  / Sunday we moved the last few things out of the house and cleaned it.  We left two large desks outside the old house as one was being given to the computer lab, and we were going to take the other to sell for scrap metal.  However, the maintenence man wanted into our cabin to paint - so once we finished cleaning he was able to do that. /  / Monday we took the metal desk to sell for scrap metal.  My husband left later to take the wooden desk to the computer lab.  I stayed home and worked at the Mechanical Turk since we finally had things hooked up so we could do that.  Later I left to spend a night with a friend I have not spent time with for over a month due to the moving complications.  He lives out on a ranch.  I walked his dog in the country, and generally relaxed and enjoyed myself in a situation where I have no responsibilities.   /  / I've completely confused the days and activities.  They are more or less in the right order, but to tell you the truth, I can't tell you exactly what I did on any one day.  Normally I have a daily todo list but it, of course, is packed and now misplaced.  On a normal day, I get up, have a pot of coffee, meditate, do yoga, and then check my email.  I help my husband with his second dialysis exchange (he is an early riser, so he does his first before I am awake).  I have a light meal.  I work on the Mechanical Turk for a few hours, or if there are no jobs available for me to do I write or draw or edit my own work.  About 3 pm I break and have another light meal and a walk, bike ride, or kayak depending on the weather.  By 4 pm I am back at the computer writing, drawing, or editing or publishing my own work on Kindle - after helping my husband with another exchange.

On Wednesday, I obviously woke up at some point and I probably showered at some point as well. On Thursday I had to be at work from 1pm to 8pm, so that is where I spent most of my day. On Friday, I also had to work, this time from 12pm to 8pm. After work I went with a coworker and a friend to see some local bands play in another friend's basement. On the way we got a case of beer. At the show, I saw a lot of people I knew and had a good time. I drank beer. After it was done, me and my friends got a pizza and went back to their house to hang out. It was kind of late and everyone was kind of tired so shortly after eating me and a friend got a ride from another friend back to my house. My friend slept over and we cuddled in my bed. He tried to kiss me but I told him not to, I just didn't feel like it. In the morning he left to go to work around 11am. I went back to sleep for another hour or two. I made plans to day drink with one of my friends, but I really didn't feel up for it. I texted her at around 3pm to see what she was doing. She said she was at the mall and I felt relieved that I wouldn't have to do anything for a little while at least. I spent the day sitting in my room watching Gossip Girl and smoking weed. My friend texted me around 7pm to say she had left the mall and could hang out. I didn't respond and planned to text her in a few hours to say that I had fallen asleep. I watched more Gossip Girl and smoked more weed. At around 9pm, I texted my friend and apologized for not texting her back, I told her I had fallen asleep. I had told another friend that I would go to her birthday party that night so also around that time I began getting ready. I cried once while trying to get dressed because I felt like none of my clothes look good on me anymore. I told myself I was being dramatic and continued getting ready. At around 11pm I got to the party. All my friends were already there. We got drunk and danced a lot. It put me in a better mood. At around 2am me and some other people went to another friend's house. We hung out there and made food and watched music videos. I left around 5am and went home and to sleep. I woke up at 11am on Sunday, I had to be at work from 12pm-8pm. After work I went home and changed quickly then got a case of beer with one of my coworkers and hung out at a friends house for a little bit. I got bored and went home around 12am. My coworker came with me and slept in the guest bedroom at my house. On Monday I didn't wake up until 2pm and I felt awful about it. I had made plans with one of my best friends but I felt so tired. I told her I had to help my mom for a few hours to buy some time. I went out to get coffee at Dunkin Donuts then went back home and forced myself through a shower. I didn't feel like doing anything. At around 5:30pm I told my friend I was done doing stuff and she came over. We bought a bottle of wine and went to her dorm room. Its summer so all the rooms were empty. We went into every single one of them, just to see. She found a mirror that someone had left and took it. We texted our friend who worked near by to see if wanted to hang out, as it was now 8pm and his shift was just ending. He agreed and we met him at his work. He drove us to his house, which is also where a lot of other friends and my best friend's boyfriend live. We got very drunk and danced. It was fun. Around 12am I went home because I had to work the next day. On Tuesday, I woke up at 5am, I had to be at work at 6am. I worked form 6am until 10am. After work I went home and sat around and smoked weed and watched Gossip Girl. At around 12am I got sad for no reason so I texted a boy I met on the internet and flirted with him until I felt better. at around 4am I went to sleep almost but then I realized a boy I met in Michigan a few weeks ago was on tour with some band. I checked to see if there was a stop on the tour in the town I'm in. There was and I really hoped he would hit me up about it. I decided I'm going to go to it regardless of if he tells me about it or not because it's at a bar and I could just pretend it was just chance I was there. Then I fell asleep. Today, Wednesday, I woke up late again, around 2pm. I felt awful about it again. I went to get coffee at Dunkin Donuts, then I sat around in my backyard on my computer until sunset.

I was upset about that, but nonetheless, my day stayed pretty routine as days 6 and 7.  4 days ago, I started planning on moving.  The bad news I got on day 5 was that I have to move.  So aside from my usual routine, I started making arrangements for a new place to live and also moving from my current location.

Be healthy. When I was younger I emphasized exercising for strength, endurance and flexibility then joked that my entire life might need to be lived with this in mind.

701807,3,2,5,GuidingValues,"The values that were instilled to me by my grandparents are probably the most important values that I have.  The first value is that you are to treat everyone with respect, even if you don't agree with them or like them you still treat them with respect.  The next is that you should also expect respect from others.  You should not be in an abusive relationship.  Next you should never lie, cheat, or steal.  Although you should never be unkind, you should also never be blunt.  Lying to others is not a form of behavior that is acceptable.  Also you should not take something that is not yours and you should not try to take advantage of other people.  You must respect people's differences and try to give them the benefit of the doubt.  You should help others out, but also trust your gut.  This means that if you see someone by the side of the road and want to help, but have an uneasy feeling in your stomach, then you should trust the uneasy feeling and not help out because your safety is important.  You can't ever take back mean words that you have said so you should choose your words very carefully.  A moment of anger can lead to years of heartache and hurt feelings.  You should be as independent as you can.  Although it can be good to rely on others for help when you need it, don't take advantage of their kindness.  Expect others to care for themselves as much as they can.  You need to realize that sometimes people need the experience of failing so that they can learn, so even if you could help them out, it might be better to let them stumble.  It might seem cruel at the time, but they will be more independent for it.  If you see someone being hurt, then step up and defend them.

It is time to move beyond simple detente with false dichotomies and acknowledge the breadth and depth of human experience. Equality does not mean that we all are or should be the same - it means that we deserve equal treatment before the law and in the face of social institutions. I believe that it is important to take care of yourself and others as we move toward a vocabulary and praxis of radical equality, because self and immediate community form the basis of larger and even global communities.

We either have a quick supper or I give the kids a snack because my oldest has swimming lessons to go to. They go until Thursday. After a half hour of swimming lessons we go home and I cook supper for my family. I set the table or have my oldest son do it. We eat supper and I clean up. If there are enough dishes I load the dishwasher. If there is time I'll put a load of laundry in. They it's usually time to feed the baby. After that we usually go outside for a little while. We usually get the chance to take a walk as long as the weather is nice. When we're done outside the kids pick up their toys and we go in for showers. I give them both a shower and then we read their nightly devotion. When they are tucked in I go and give the baby a bath. Once that's done it's bottle time and then to bed. Once all the kids are sleeping I'll take a shower myself. After I'm done I'll watch tv for a little while and usually fall asleep in the chair.

737432,5,1,3,GuidingValues,"One of my most important guiding values is the Kantian categorical imperative. This means that in every interaction with others I try my hardest to treat them as humans rather than as objects. The categorical imperative focuses on a good will as the ultimate, non-instrumental expression of the good. Thus, people who follow it must always make moral decisions treating humanity as an end rather than a means. How exactly does this translate to daily life? This is a hard question for fans of Kant. For me it mostly involves reminding myself that people are not objects, that they are all complex and well-meaning people who are just trying to understand the world around them. I think this makes me a lot less cynical than I normally am. This way of thinking reminds me that I am no better than the people around me, and even though I am smarter than most of the people around me I must still treat them as equals and as humans, rather than as means to my ends",v,174,37.7,8.44,86.26,74.09,19.33,17.82,86.21,74.71,63.22,18.97,12.07,8.62,0,0,0,2.3,6.9,18.39,6.9,0.57,17.24,6.32,8.62,9.77,1.15,12.64,6.32,4.6,1.72,0,1.72,0,22.99,2.3,20.69,6.32,2.3,2.87,1.15,0.57,5.75,1.15,3.45,3.45,0,1.15,1.15,0,0,0,0,0,11.49,2.87,1.72,0,0,0.57,0.57,8.05,0,0,0,0

There's no use to be mourning over a close one that died over 5 years ago, because being sad isn't going to bring that person back to life. SO I guess another important value to me is Happiness. You are in control of your happiness, and no one else can take that from you unless you let them. Happiness is important because you never know when it's your last day. There is no need to go through life sad or depressed because this is YOUR LIFE. Why waste it on sadness? I wouldn't.

That's not to say depending on others is bad or wrong, but one should be able to form their own opinions about anything and shouldn't rely on others to think for them. After freedom, health is extremely important. To live a long life, you must take care of your body, because it is the only one you have while you are on this earth. Whether or not you believe in an afterlife is irrelevant to this; a healthy body is a happy body. Speaking on freedom once again, it is this thing which allows people to choose how they interact with each other. Sure, freedom allows for negative interactions, but not without consequences.

Thus, things that are most important to me are to be independent and not have to rely on someone else's good nature. I find myself too caught up in emotional drama and dynamics and it wears me out.

Thus, I would rather just focus on what works for me, which is getting things done in a neat, orderly way, and just making it through life day by day.

All of my values come primarily from the church, because my parents were very big in the church as well, so they taught me to follow the Biblical guidelines not only by word, but by example as well. I was taught to love and forgive others, to treat others as I would want to be treated, and to care for people who were less fortunate then I was. I will admit that there were times I fought against my values, but I never really stepped over the line where I knew there would be no turning back.  /  / Another value that guides my life is the hard work ethic that my culture taught me. From the time I was young, I was taught that in order to get anything in life, you have to work hard for it. I started doing chores for a few coins when I was around ten, and in everything I've done in life since, I've tried to maintain the same work ethic that I had when I was young (even though it's not always easy).  /  / The third value that I have is one of frugality. Even though I have money, my parents taught me from an early age that just because I had money didn't mean that I got to spend it whenever I wanted, so I learned early on the value of saving a dollar. People might call me cheap, but I figure that saving my money is better then spending it (with rare exceptions).",v,298,16.27,1,99,45.47,24.83,10.4,89.6,79.87,66.44,21.48,14.43,13.42,0,0.34,0,0.34,7.05,16.78,6.04,1.68,13.76,11.41,7.38,7.38,1.68,19.46,6.38,4.03,5.7,2.68,2.01,1.01,12.08,1.34,10.74,2.01,1.01,1.34,1.34,0.34,4.7,0,3.02,2.35,0.67,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,9.73,3.69,0.67,0,0.34,1.01,0.67,4.36,0.67,0,0,0

In order for me to take care of myself, I need to be healthy. I need to be healthy so that I can work and work towards whatever my goals may be. I have lost weight, and although I still have some weight to lose, I have definitely come a long way and I am proud of that. Being healthy is not only not being sick, but being in shape, eating heatlhy, caring about what I am putting into my body. If I am fit and in shape today, and I continue with my ways, chances are I will continue that way for a long time and I will be able to work or do whatever I want for a long time.  /  / Another important value to me is pleasure.

I remember I was supposed to meet my trainer Thursday morning (personal fitness trainer) for a workout, but I went to bed very late and wasn't feeling very well when I woke up. So, I texted her and told her I would not be making it in. Then, I went back to bed. I slept pretty late that day (as is usual the last couple of weeks) but I don't remember exactly what time I woke up. After I woke up, I believe I did a practice exam (I am studying for an actuarial exam currently), but I can't be 100% sure. I do know that we had a cookout to go to with Josh's (my boyfriend) family. We left for the cookout around 5pm and got there at about 5:30. There was mostly mexican food - tacos, chicken, steak, guacamole, etc. We were informed once we got there that we would be going to another cookout directly after. I did not realize this, so I ate way too much. We left for the other cookout and that cookout had burgers, hotdogs, etc. We ate and then just sat and chatted for a while.After that, we came home and I think we just watched some TV or something. I imagine on Friday, we also slept pretty late - but again, I can't remember what time I woke up. The only thing I really remember from that day is that we went to Josh's aunts house for mexican food and to hang out with his parents because it was their last day in town. We had tacos and gorditos. After we hung out and chatted for a while, his parents took us out for ice cream at Baskin Robbins. I had the reeses peanut butter cup ice cream. We came home after that and relaxed. I do not remember anythign from Saturday or sunday. Monday, I woke up around 10 to get ready and left my apartment around 11:15 to head to my babysitting job.

Downtime is rarely a positive thing and to be constantly engaged in a task or moving in a particular direction is always progress.  When people see you always striving to meet a goal, they are more prone to open up other new possibilities for you, which in turn allows you to work even harder toward an even larger goal.  I think laziness has undone plenty of great thinkers and has subverted a lot of positive outcomes for people.  If I couldn't work constantly at one project or another, I would begin to slip into an apathetic state that would be very difficult to shake myself free from. / I also believe that honesty springs from hard work.

It's the only thing I cared about. I lost sight of the fact that I wanted real lusty type of love as well. What I found out was that I couldn't have both. So I chose friends instead of that. It bugs me. I think about it. What life would have been like had I made different choices. I guess at the end of the day though I still have my friends. Which is what I wanted. I've also learned that you have to be careful what you wish for. Now I'm trying to focus on other things I want different. For instance I don't want to be payment friendly my whole life.

I went to boot camp on Monday to workout and it was an exhausting workout. I felt good though. I came home and enjoyed a breakfast protein shake. Work has been a little harder with eating well because they have had a different potluck everyday this week. Thursday I went back to boot camp, but my trainer stood me up and that was rather frustrating. Saturday I was suppose to go to yoga with my friend Stacey, but she had to go to the cemetery with her family. So working out this week has been a total bust. Work has been mildly crazy. No real excitement. The person that was missing all last week finally quit so I was able to get perfect attendance for my team for the first time in a while. This is allowing my team to win the Survivor game. I fully expect to win! Friday was suppose to start my Staycation, but that isn't turning out like I expected it too. My husband was suppose to be off most of it and that didn't work out like I thought it would. On Friday he was given a bunch of claims. Good thing because it's what pays the bills, but sucky because I really wanted to get some things finished. I was able to completely get the laundry finished. Now I just need to put it away. I'll be planting a pablano plant here shortly along with a raspberry tree. Yesterday we went to Sears and bought a grill. We've got to get this put together before tomorrow for the cookout. I had dinner with my family on Friday. Now exactly what I wanted to do, but the food was pretty good and overall it was a good time. That night I had my cousin over and a friend. It was a pretty decent evening. My cousin is overcoming the loss of her fianc√©. I try keep her mind off of it while she's here. It's not always an easy task, but we are making head way. They cancelled the SME program at work. This was a blow to everyone at work. Basically our floor support is now non existent. Plus is was a good program to see who would step up and be the next leaders. I've tried really hard the last few days to not be upset with my husband because he's had to work, but that's been difficult. Yesterday I watched a movie. It was awful. I believe it was called About Time. I was shocked to see that Rachel McAdams was in yet another movie about time travel. I had expected to spend the whole weekend not drinking but that didn't workout. I had drinks with friends both Friday and Saturday night. Oh well, I suppose. My husband and I decided to build a deck yesterday as an addition to our concrete porch. We are going to acid stain the concrete a darker color and do a dark wood for the addition. I think it should look rather nice. Instead of beams we are going to use a metal wire in the cross sections. I've watered my plants everyday and so far they are coming along nicely. I've already got three baby green tomatoes on my yellow cherry plant. I'm really hoping I have so many tomatoes I can't eat them all. Yesterday I went to DJ's with friends and had drinks. They are my oldest high school friends. I'm grateful that I can still say they are in my life. Today at our trip to Walmart we bought bean bags for the corn hole boards. That should be a good time tomorrow. I haven't dried my hair at all the last few days. It feels good to be a little lazy. Yesterday night my dog Max got up in the middle of the night and had to go outside. It was about 4 am in the morning. Of course when I went back to bed I couldn't sleep, so I got on Facebook and some other websites to waste some time until I fell back to sleep. I caught up on my soap operas yesterday. I'm really going to miss Sammy and EJ when they leave the show this fall. Today I'm watching Labor Day with my husband. I started it earlier but had to stop it because he stated that he'd like to watch it as well. It looks to be a much better movie than yesterday. I watched all the episodes we had of Shark Tank as well. I really hate running out of those episodes because I like them so much. Today we went to Hardees for lunch. It was disappointing. I will have to put that on my don't eat there for a while list. We finally bought batteries today. Now I realize this sounds like a simple task, but we've been transferring batteries back and forth for a while. It will be nice to stop doing this activity. I fed the cats yesterday. This morning there was either food still left in their dish or my husband beat me to it because there was food in the bowl. As I'm looking up out my window I wonder if we should stain our fence. I might suggest this later. We got a call from our lawn guy today saying that he would not be mowing today but tomorrow. This could cause a dilemma since we have a cookout tomorrow. I sent out a text while we were at about our cookout. So far no one has replied. Yesterday I bought some nail polish and painted my nails.

855349,7,2,2,GuidingValues,To me one of the most important values that guides me is honesty. I feel that in order to be able to really trust a person and who they are and what they say you need to believe them. It's hard not to be able to trust someone and it's also hard to be able to respect someone that lies all the time. So because of reasons such as those I choose to almost always tell the truth. The only time I do not is if it's a little white lie to one of my kids that they don't need to know the answer to anyways. I also feel that it's extremely important to once you commit to something do it. You shouldn't make promises you can't keep. If you're not sure if you're able to do something then don't say you'll be there 100% because all that does is lead to disappointment and who wants to be disappointed. I also feel that another value that guides me is compassion. I truly care for those in my life and I also care for others even if I don't know them. I feel for others who are going through a hard time or others who don't have a good support system or for those who are just less fortunate. I really feel deeply for others. I am also a very good listener and a true friend. I also think that another value that guides me is being a hard worker. I set goals and I strive to reach them. I give it my all no matter what I am doing and feel that is the only way to be. Why just go at something and only do part of the work or give it just half of yourself - if you want something you should go after it full force. I think that I also value my faith and this is sometimes something which really helps me get through the hardest of times and helps me make those difficult decisions in life when I feel no one else can help. ,v,348,1.91,10.64,82.53,69.95,19.33,9.77,94.83,83.91,69.83,26.44,14.37,8.33,0,2.87,0,1.72,12.07,14.37,4.31,1.15,10.92,11.78,8.33,9.48,3.16,20.98,4.89,3.74,6.32,2.01,2.87,1.72,23.28,3.16,20.11,4.6,2.3,2.3,5.46,1.72,6.03,0,6.03,4.6,1.44,1.15,0.57,0.57,0,0,0.57,0,14.37,5.75,2.3,0,0,0.29,1.15,8.05,0.57,0.29,0,0

I did work a few days last week but I was able to get out of here early on Friday and also had Monday off. It was nice having that extra time with my friends and family. We did have some plans for the weekend but for the most part we had more free time than usual. Friday night my husband and my kids and I played some board games and treated ourselves to some pizza. On Saturday it was a gorgeous day and so we spent the entire day outside. The kids played while we got our lawn more ready for summer. We got our gazebo and furniture out and did some planting and weeding. So nice this time of year when things start growing. We also spent some time with our neighbors. We had a party at my sisters house and got to play some games outside because it was once again a beautiful day. I met some people I hadn't met yet and got to see a lot of my sister's friends I hadn't seen in awhile and also got to see almost all of my family which is always nice. We ate a lot of good food and just had a great time. The kids played nicely with their cousins and some neighborhood kids so we had a little more freedom than usual. We had another party yesterday at my in laws and we got to see everyone on my husbands side of the family including our new nephew who is only about 2 months old now. The kids played baseball while the adults sat out in the sun and just relaxed for a change. Then it was time to go home and get ready for work and school again. I woke up bright and early this morning and met up with a couple of my friends for a run. Although none of us were feeling all that great we managed to get a nice run in before the craziness of our days began. Then it was home to get the kids ready and for us to get ready for work.

I'm not oblivious to the fact that life is hard, but I think that some seek to take more than their fair share and it drives me to anger. Some might say I'm not being fair to those who seek out the upper hand, but I think they are mistaken and weak. I am also a proponent of people testing their artistic abilities. I try to encourage my friends to explore their interests in art and music as often as I can. I believe in hard work, but I do not think that has to come at the expense of one's own happiness. If you hate what you are doing, then by all means, stop doing it. You only hurt yourself when you neglect your passions. We only get one life to live as far as we know, so really LIVE it.

A person can have many flaws but if he/she is honest, it makes up for quite a few of them.  Another value I have is to make sacrifices for my family.  Family members need to rely on each other and be there for each other when needed.  I always try to keep my family in mind, and when i fail at that, i feel very bad.  Another central value is being able to have freedom in having my opinion.  Whether involving religion, politics, or any controversial topic, it's important that i'm true to my opinion.  I'm willing to change opinions if I see they need correcting, but it's equally important to be firm in my opinions regardless of what others believe, and not back down from those opinions.

909696,5,2,3,GuidingValues,"One of my most important values is honesty. I don't mean white lies like saying you like someone's haircut when you don't, but honesty in spirit about anything that is important. Other people do not share this value and they assume everyone else is like them, which can make it very difficult to live life as an honest person. Honesty is basically punished in our society. Of course, dishonesty is sometimes punished also. Although this is a moral value, it is also a practical value. Those who are not in the dominant group in society cannot be caught in dishonesty or we will be punished disproportionately. But if convenient members of the dominant group will assume or say I have been dishonest and there is nothing I can do about it. I have lost work due to my reputation for honesty but did it help me when I needed to pursue justice in a lawsuit -- no, it did not -- my reputation for honesty was considered irrelevant. / Another essential value is not to steal or manipulate. In Buddhist terms this is: Do not take what is not freely given. One of the most important reasons for this value (as well as for honesty) is just to make one's own life easier. One can love oneself and sleep soundly at night if one is honest and does not take from others -- I am probably one of the few people I have ever met who has been able to follow this path and I am so glad because I do experience the rewards of it directly in the ease in my life. With these values, although there is sometimes temptation, except in rare circumstances decisions are relatively easy to make. Of course, there are exceptions. One does not have to tell the truth to a psycho who is holding one captive or to people who have asked one a question that is clearly none of their business.

Once work is over each day, I go home to my wife and we hang out and talk with each other about how the day went, or something interesting we read about in the news that day. Then we usually walk our dogs and get ready to make dinner. We cook for about an hour, eat dinner, then put aside the leftovers for lunch the next day. Then we usually watch TV and go to bed.  / This past weekend, my parents came into town to visit (since they live many miles away) and my wife, my brother, and I met up with them at an amusement park and we hung out there together most of the day. It was hot, so we got tired quickly, but we still had a lot of fun enjoying the park and each other's company. Then we went out to eat together and caught a movie that was out in theaters.

970198,5,2,5,GuidingValues,"My guiding values when I was a kid were a very confused mishmash of nothings and sensations of guilt and vague religiousity. I felt very controlled by my parents and tried as best I could just to cultivate something of an independent identity. Eventually I encountered the music of Rage Against the Machine and found my way into politics and Noam Chomsky. So for a while my values were expressed in terms of a political understanding, of sympathizing with oppressed people and being skeptical of the government and authority figures generally. Shortly after this I encountered the work of Ayn Rand and objectivism. This was a profound influence on me, and lead me to embrace the importance of objective knowledge, of reason, of individuality, of self-esteem. At a similar time I read George Orwell's 1984. And, I may have been very unique in this, but I read Ayn Rand as a rather natural extension of Noam Chomsky and George Orwell- suspicion of a controlling authoritarian state. I never met any objectivist or conservative who agreed with my views on these subjects. /  / In college I traded this in, feeling Objectivism was too narcisstic. I exchanged Ayn Rand for analytic philosophy, and for philosophy of science, and for a form of moral realism that locals moral value in the natural world. Also I combined this with a kind of wonder and fascination toward nature and toward science, and found Richard Feynman and Carl Sagan to be profound influences. Today I think of my values largely in terms of the fact that they can be navigated via logic and reason, and that even the deepest spiritual experiences, though authentic and real, can be understood without resort to religious or overly philosophical explanation. The biochemistry of my brain gives rise to experiences of wonder and beauty, and that is okay. /  / Post college, I have tried to become more empathetic and forgiving. To learn to ""go with the flow"" to support people, and to learn to build relationships over the medium and long term. To realize that I need to be supportive, that other people matter just as much as me, and that I should be proactive and work to shape moments in other peoples lives in a beneficial way.

985626,6,2,1,Behaviors7days,"Since my return from New York and over the course of the past seven days I was able to fly back from Miami, invest, and then re-invest in a hybrid Raleigh mountain trail bike. It's kind of crazy when I think about it, because the bike was the beginning of my new development plan that included learning how to boogie board and get into shape by biking to the beach.  It was a goal that I had set for myself, so it was exciting as well as nerve racking when I shelled out over 600 dollars for this bike.  I was excited; biked around the neighborhood and the following day opted to use the bike to go to target.  The day was off and I knew it, the moment I dropped the phone from my bed that morning. The iPhone screen was cracked! I had things I wanted to do, I wanted to bike, go grocery shopping, blah. blah blah....well, on the way home from my shopping experience at target, i learned that I shouldn't use the bike for shopping. I stopped to drop off my phone. It took 2 minutes to hand over the phone and settle up to the house.  The wait was supposed to be two hours.  It was twenty minutes when the phone tech called to say the phone was ready. I thought, first to walk to the shop, but I had this brand new bike I thought, and gosh would I love to bike across the street.   /  / Well. I watched him steal my bike, I was steps away when I saw him grab the handle and turn the wheel. I heard a voice just a second prior that said - ""he's going to steal your bike"" - and there it was, gone.  The keystone cops arrived, not impressed by my bike story. Very strange encounter it was, but I placed a formal report and prayed about the bike. I got in a car and went looking of course,but no luck and frustration mounted by the hour.  I returned the rent by the minute car and walked into the same shop and purchased the same bike with a few more accessories and doubled down on an investment I made with myself. Ive made this commitment you see. A commitment to myself to be better than I was when I arrived. Its a 30 day commitment. The goal is to set life patterns that set healthy lifetime habits. The goal is to be a better human being and the type of human being I set my verbal standards as being The goal is to develop better hobbies, learn new cultures, see the world and admiring the view. /  / ",v,450,73.08,5.98,92.92,81.12,18,12.67,79.78,72,55.78,14.44,10,8.89,0,0.44,0.67,0,4.44,16.67,10.44,2,14.44,7.33,3.56,7.33,0.67,17.33,4.89,4,2.89,0.67,2.67,0.22,7.33,0.22,7.11,2,1.56,1.33,0.44,0.44,1.56,0,6,4.89,0.89,1.78,0.67,0.89,0,0.22,0,0,6.89,4.44,0.22,0,0,0,2.22,2,0,0,0,0.67

988993,5,2,4,GuidingValues,"I would have to say that one of the most important values that guides me in selfishness.  By this, I mean that I nurture myself and live for my self.  Lots of people perceive selfishness as a bad thing, but it can actually be quite moral and healthy.  For example, I am a blood donor.  This might be perceived as a selfless act, but in all actuality, it is not.  Part of the reason I do this is because it gives me a sense of empowerment knowing that I can have an impact on someone's life.  Selfishness in the better sense of the word has to do with pursuing the goals that YOU wish to pursue and NOT living for someone else.  /  /  Another value is imagination.  Too many people merely accept that they have to live a certain way because it is expected.  They think they have to work in an office, get married, move into a white picket fence neighborhood, have kids, etc.  Ultimately, people should do what they want to do, within reason. /  / Fun is a more important value than many people realize.  Too often, work and obligations gobble up free time, leaving no room for merely enjoying life.  People should have fun based on what they like to do.  It is OK to stay in on a Saturday night watching a movie and eating popcorn, and it is just as OK to go ghost-hunting in a cemetery and then go home and build an indoor fort and tell scary stories.

Then after we made the enchiladas we focused on getting the dishes clean. It progressed into making turkey burgers today with gourmet homemade sauce.

999698,6,2,0.16045251,GuidingValues,"The values that guide my life are pretty simple. I am not religious but I believe in being a moral and good person because I feel like you should treat others how you would want to be treated. You only have this life to live so you want to make the most of it by being nice and good. That helps you enjoy life and is also more fair to others because they only have one life to live too. They have enough problems with their lives already without me adding to them so that is why I try to be nice to people. Honesty and loyalty are two big things to me and whenever I make decisions I try to think of if this would be the honest thing to do and if this would exhibit loyalty toward my friends and family. I think about the greater good and if an action would provide more good than harm. Another value that is really important to me is freedom. I like having freedom to do what I want, when I want. I don't like being told what to do or restricted and that is reflected in my choice of jobs - I found a job where I can set my own hours and work schedule so that I can fit my work around my life and not fit my life around my work like how most people do.",v,237,4.9,5.66,70.56,95.52,23.7,10.13,94.94,80.59,68.35,21.52,14.35,10.55,0,2.11,0,1.69,7.17,13.92,2.95,0.84,13.08,12.66,8.44,10.55,1.27,20.25,7.17,4.64,5.06,2.11,2.11,0.84,18.14,0,18.14,4.22,2.95,5.49,2.11,0.42,5.06,0,7.59,6.75,0.84,2.11,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,12.24,3.8,1.69,0,0,1.27,0.42,5.91,0.42,0.42,0,0

I have played video games online with a friend of mine each night after dinner. He is an old friend from high school and this is how we keep in touch. I am been writing a lot of articles. My job is a sports and gaming writer and I write articles about sports and video games every day. I work from hom so I can work whenever I want as long as I submit articles before deadlines. A few days ago I went to eat for my mom's birthday. We went to a local bar and grill. During the weekend I went to a local Magic: The Gathering tournament at a nearby card shop. Yesterday I talked to my brother on the phone about a business he is putting together and agreed to help make him a website for the business. I also started reading a book series called the Wheel of Time this week. I try to read for at least one hour each night before going to bed. Over the last 7 days I have exercised all 7 days as well. I lift weights daily in order to keep in shape. I shower after each weight lifting session, of course.
