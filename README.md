testing push pull in a public repo

This line is from R studio. 

This is a second line from R studio, since i seem to need lots of practice. 

On the abvoe, we skipped the stage/commit and went striaght to push, which worked. but still lets try it again. 

Ok, it seemed to take a couple of tries for that to work. Was it just slow, or did I do something out of sequence. Let's repeat the steps again. These steps are: 

 + write some nonsense (done)
 + select the box under staged on the git tab below 
 + hit commit
 + write more nonsense. 
 + hit push. 
 
Is that correct? 

## Followup 

Ok, we checked and all this stuff is on Git. Next we will open and save another file - after committing this. 

## Really going for it.

Perhaps getting ehead of ourselves. We are going to write this sentence and then try to pull it to Rstudio. 

Wow that worked. this is fantastic.
