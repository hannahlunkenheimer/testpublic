The ability to be independent comes via my love of learning.

Treating others with respect means everything and can make the difference between a frustrating life and a rewarding one. Everyone wants the same thing, when you get right down to it. People want to be treated with respect and have a life with as little pain as possible. Focusing on the humanity in everyone you meet cab defuse a bad situation, build a bridge between enemies, repair a broken relationship, etc. Finding the courage to admit that you're wrong and being big enough to apologize can work wonders. Kindness is key. /  / Fairness is a close second. Everyone deserves an equal chance, no one should be excluded from the chance to succeed and thrive. Simple things like not cutting in line, not stiffing the waiter on a tip, telling the cashier who gave you too much money back, are important ways to keep things ""even"" and fair.

I am guided by the lessons taught in scripture through the behaviors of people in relation to the instructions of Ancient of Days. I value honesty, truth, love, obedience, patience, kindness, consideration, faith, sexual responsibility, marriage between one man and one woman, and strict following of biblical moral code. In difficult situations, I look to the bible to direct my actions. I know to not love mother, father, sister, brother or friend more than the Ancient of Days. Because any of those people can lead me astray, but the Most High will never lead me astray. I am honest in everything I do because I despise liars and want to remain in truth. I am loving toward those who strive for the understanding that only Most High can give. I am obedient to the Most High because I know that he will try me and prune me and continue to make me into a better person: a sanctuary for His Holy Spirit. I am patient because this life on earth is a trial for me to go through. I have to be patient and allow the Most High to bring me through all of my trials and tests so that I can hopefully enter into His kingdom. I am kind because I would life for people to be kind to me. I don't want to be deliberately unkind because I would feel like a bad person, and it would make me feel ashamed and guilty for mistreating other people. I am considerate because a fair and just society requires that people be considerate of other people. If everyone just cared about themselves, then there would be no cooperation or peace. I am faithful to Most High because He is responsible for my extreme improvement as a person. I trust Him completely with my  life. Sex is something that is easily misused and abused. That is why I am for sexual responsiblity under biblical law. ","I woke up and watered my plants. I then took a shower. I ate breakfast, consisting of an apple and peanuts.

150635,"To me it is important to not inherit bad karma, but take care of myself enough to not be stepped on by others.  I realize that I am not mature enough to fully allow myself to let go of the illusions and barriers I self create for myself.  For this reason, I am not ready to be walked all over and am working hard to maintain peace within my external and internal environment to achieve good karmic status, without letting myself get walked on by others.  I still have to survive and take care of my physical self, and right now that is a primary goal so I can closer focus on more spiritual leanings.  I try not to value anything in particular too hard, or else I fear that I will get caught in a trap that keeps me from reaching the ultimate source of truth.  This ultimate source of truth is without judgement or discernment and seeing things for how they truly are without distinguishing.  This is very difficult to do, but it is a practice nonetheless.  I'm starting to unlock things that I am not quite ready to handle, but at the same time, my life is very interesting and I am not afraid of what happens in it, or at least I'd like to think that.  That being said, there are still some values I find more pleasing than others based on my personality archetype regardless of how detached from that I should be.  I value creativity, open-mindedness and intelligence in the second highest regard.  Humility and gentleness are also valued, but I don't beleive in being a pushover because I see Darwinism as an equally plausible possibility.  Overall I am very confused because I see so many angles, but I know that it is not my intention to hurt anybody and if people valued what I value this world might be a much more evolved place, as ego-centric as that sounds.  ","Since it is Thursday, I will start with last Thursday.  I spent the day waking up at 9:30 in the morning and going to work at 10.  I work at a local grocery store and stock shelves with food products.  I get a 30 minute lunch, which I usually spend going to Subway, McDonald's or Arbys.  All three taste very good.  I then finish working at six.  I did the same thing Friday and Saturday with the same hours.  Saturday night I decided to grab me a six pack of beer before heading home to a lonely night with myself. This is very typical lately, but rest assured, I don't mind it one bit.  I've grown a sudden distaste for others and social interactions in general.  I usually spend my free time playing or creating music or exploring the internet.  I do this all day Sunday and Monday on my day off, albeit I spent a small portion of time with my family eating at a local restaurant.  The food was delicious and I didn't mind the occasional company.  Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday was all spent at work during my usual hours.  I then spent those evenings on Mechanical Turk working to save up funds for future relocation to a different state.  This Thursday, today, has followed the same pattern.  I am now sitting here taking yet another survey and giving you insights into my, seemingly boring life.  But rest assured, my life is not boring on the inside.  I enjoy myself quite a bit.  The characters I create in my head are quite interesting and the scenarios I imagine have great flavor.  I will most likely have a lucid dream tonight as this is becoming a regular occurrence.

157541,"My parents taught me that it was important to stay true to yourself. That people were not going to like you no matter what you did or said and it was important to find those people that liked you for you and so you needed to be strong and stand up for the things you believed in no matter what your friends, school mates or coworkers thought. Another principle that my parents stressed was fulfilling your obligations. If you promised someone or committed to something you had to stick it out to the end because other people were depending on you and you couldn't let them down. So, it was always very important to weigh your actions before you said or did anything because you needed to be sure this was something you could do. Honesty was also very important. People make mistakes and accidents happen but you always needed to be honest about them. If you lied you got into more trouble while growing up than if you owned up to what happened. Being honest isn't always easy but it was important that you learned to take responsibility for your actions and learn to face up and deal with any issues that you caused. My parents weren't religious but taught us that being a good, honest and trustworthy person was what was important in life. If you treated others as you wanted to be treated then you weren't going to make too many wrong decisions or do too many bad things. Living a good life is all anyone could hope or ask for and it was something that my parents instilled in us at an early age. Now, it is second nature and I always feel that I have given and done the best in the situations that I come across.","This time of year my weekly schedule revolves around one thing -- baseball.

All within the next 12 hours, we looked at cars, sold my van, and purchased a car for me. During the whole process of trying to sell my vehicle, I had a terrible migraine. On Sunday, I woke up early and got my coffee and then went to church to run the live video switcher. I was able to train a student too.

I believe that this world of ours is a very corrupt world, where there is no respect for other people. such things as human trafficking and self-interest of other politicians and of power are the things i dislike the most, and one of the things i would want to accomplish is to change the way society is now going. i guess i want people to respect other people for the sake of being humans. and for my personal being, i would want someone to respect me not just because they love me or because i am a woman, but because i am a person too. and that means i am also worthy of being respected. /  / The second would be loyalty/fidelity. I think that this two are interrelated with each other and i would require this to anyone worthy enough of my trust and affection. i do not want a beyond perfect someone. just a person who is loyal to me. i guess this also includes the government. if only they were loyal to the people, thinking only of what good they're actions will bring the people, then i guess people will learn how to value government. /  / Finally, compassion. My father told me that to handle my self i have to use my head; to handle other i have to use my heart. for the most part i agree with him, but since the world has changed over the past decade, i think i have to use both to deal with people. the world is a cruel place for the weak and the vulnerable, and so i have taken it to consideration that when in the near future i am now in the line of public service, i will not forget to help those who are in deep need and trouble, for i know that the only thing that will give me fulfillment in my work is when i have at least, made a change in our society and the people living in it.

187647,"Being respectful to others is very important to anyone in any situation. I think making a good first impression is the best way to lead your life and I don't mean that as a superfical or materialistic kind of way. People judge you constantly whether or not you know it and make assumptions about you. You need to listen to others to gain their respect. Once respect is obtained then trust is obtained then a lasting relationship can be started. Being nice to people just makes life easier for you and others. I think people are inheritaly good and bad or painful experiences turn people into mean, unrespectful, individuals who don't take care of themselves or others around them. When you are nice to others they are nice to you back, I have done this myself for many years. People will eventually show their true colors to you when they get stressed out. I've seen this working in retail for many years as a customer service associate. If you are willing to listen and be respectful and nice then people are more likely to cooperate with you.

If you go with love you can live a life in harmony with others.  Fear is the opposite of love, and does not truly exist.  Fear is the rejection of love and placing emphasis on your physical being,  This physical being exists only as a way to experience love.  Love is present in all aspects of you life and it is up to you to embrace it without fear.  When you love yourself you will radiate love to all those around you and make the world a better place.  The choice to live with love and without fear is hard for many people, the ego gets in the way of your love because it has fear.

192733,"Being healthy is important because without that, most of the other attributes have less flavor.  It is less interesting and perhaps possible to have a zest for sex and pleasure and travel and even curiosity if ou are mired in a dungeon of bed and pills.  Health lets a person appreciate what there is in the world, and gives a person options.  Health is generally subject to a person's control of lifestyle and habits.  What isn't controllable is just random fate, and acceptance of fate is another important value.  In my opinion most things flow from health and acceptance of the result of a person's efforts.  To be envious or wish for something else is a detriment to health and lads to a less satisfying life.  Most things are not in my control, but how I treat my body and how I accept life are.","A week ago I was working on my car.

196718,"My most important virtues and guiding values are the ones that I believe allow me to be the best person I can be and to have the biggest effect on the world that I can. At the core to these values is love, which I believe to be the most powerful force in the Universe except for God. If you're acting out of love, it's rare that you'll act in a way that's immoral or in a way that could harm others. It is love that enables us to engage in self sacrifice, and love that gives us a reason to live, even more so than our work passions and hopes and dreams give us. Along with love is kindness. I believe that in nearly every situation, we can pause and make a choice to act out of love, kindness, integrity and doing the right thing or not. Even when we're angry, sad or depressed. It amazes me sometimes how people make choices to be cruel and how some are capable of acts which are evil, because it seems to me that they could stop and think and make the choice to go in the other direction by acting out of kindness, love and righteousness.","The past seven days have been relatively routine, every weekday I've woken up early to work on Mturk, then I spent the rest of the day either working on my animated film or studying for my final which I have tomorrow.

197364,"My most important value, considering that I study psychology and want to eventually be a therapist, is that you should never judge a person for any behavior. There is always room for change, and often times a less than desirable behavior can be treated and reversed. A person may be an ""asshole,"" but we really can't judge them because they are probably dealing with internal struggles that are being untreated. I believe everyone can change. I used to be an incredibly depressed person who had attempted suicide three times. Now I'm sitting here, acknowledging my past, and I know that I will never go back to those feelings. If I can change, anyone can. In psychology, one of the first things you learn about is the fundamental attribution error. Essentially this means that one's behavior cannot be attributed to a single, or fundamental, cause. When interacting with others, I always keep this in mind. If someone is rude to me at my place of work (retail), I may first curse at them in my own head, but then I stand back and consider what their home life must be like. Maybe they're going through a divorce, maybe they've just been laid off from work, or maybe they're just having a general bad day. I don't judge people. Everyone has their reasons for how they act and they deserve our respect, even if they themselves are not being respectful.","Last week I went to my art history class and listened to a lecture and participated a bit, then I went to work at Barnes and Noble, cashiered a bit and worked on some of the clothing we sell (folding, primping, etc).

203131,"I am a mother first. The well being of my children ALWAYS comes first. During my day to day activities almost everything I do is centered around my children. I am also a full time student seeking a Bachelors in Elementary Education. Part of the reason I choose this is so that I will not only be able to provide better for my family, but the schedule would also allow me to be there more for my family. For me, without my family I am almost nothing. I work on myself and take care of my needs not just for myself, but also with my family in mind. I try my best to be honest in all that I do, however there are times where I lie or stretch the truth in the interest of achieving a particular end result. I work very hard in all that I do. When I am given or set a goal for my life I do not give up easily. It is important for me to achieve the goal even if it requires very long and hard work. I want to set a good example for my children through my hard work in life. While money is important, it is not everything. You do need some money to survive and to afford some of the creature comforts of life. Being a mom of two and a full time student we are extremely poor. There are times when I worry that we will not even be able to afford our necessities. However, this rough time is temporary because I know and have faith that the things that I'm currently working on in my life will pan out for the best in the long run. Because of all of my hard work now my children will be provided for and will be given advantages to help them to succeed. Education is extremely important in life, not just the book knowledge but the real world knowledge as well. That is where the real wealth comes in and is something I hope to teach my children about so that they will be able to live a truly full life.","For the past week I have been doing my best to figure out how to help my family overcome our current financial crisis. I typically wake up around 6am when my 4 month old daughter awakes. The first thing I do is give her some cuddles to help her wake up not so fussy and I change her diaper. Then I place her in her swing while I have my morning caffeine for a few minutes. Then I make her her bottle and enjoy the quiet time with her. After she is finished I then begin working on whatever the priority is for that day. My fiancee works full time at a security company and typically leaves in the morning before we wake up. However due to his unemployment before he got that job we are playing catch up with bills and praying we get the money before things get turned off. With two small children (4 months old and 3 years old) it is difficult for me to work outside of the home. According to the math and research I've done I would bring home a max of $80 a week after paying for daycare expenses, gas, and other misc expenses needed for working outside of the home. This is why I choose to work on MTURK and do other online work as I can find it to try and bring in what I can to contribute to the bills. Typically I will work on MTURK until my son wakes up around 830/9am. Then I take a break and have breakfast with my son while watching an educational cartoon of his choice. Then I work for about another hour. Depending on the weather I may take my son outside for about an hour of outside play time or we stay inside and find an activity. After that I do bath time for both of my kids, and then lunch. After lunch I work online for another hour or two before putting the kids down for a nap. I may juggle necessary phone calls during my son's play time depending on the day. During my kids nap time I handle household chores for about an hour and the rest of the time is spent working. After their nap I get him settle with a snack and an activity while I try to squeeze in a little more work before I start cooking dinner. About that time my fiancee gets home from work and we catch up on our day while cooking dinner. After dinner is when I typically take my shower. Then I try to spend at least an hour relaxing with my fiancee before he goes to bed. Because of my daughters current sleep schedule me and her typically will stay up for another hour or two. Depending on how she is I will either focus my complete attention on her, or will put her in her swing or set her next to me while I try to get some more work done. Once she finally falls asleep for the evening I might work for another hour and then wrap things up to get myself in bed. I don't make much for the amount of work that I do on MTURK, but it is definitely more than I would make trying to work outside of the home and pay for daycare for two small children. Plus it allows me to be with my children more and ensure that they are raised with the values I find important. Lately we have not had the money to do much aside from work. I know this will come to an end as soon as school starts back in the fall and I receive my loan money which will pay for their daycare while I am in class and student teaching. This time next year I will be graduated and hopefully have a full time teaching job that will allow me the freedom to have a little more down time with my family.",2,4,white,English,4,2,v,361,22.34,96.68,18.05,13.85,77.29,65.93,17.45,12.74,11.08,0.83,0,0.55,10.25,2.77,6.65,1.11,14.4,1.94,12.47,1.39,1.39,1.66,1.94,2.22,4.71,0,5.82,0.83,1.66,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.83,5.54,4,High,3,2,Low

However, after my husband passed away and I almost simultaneously lost my job, I realized that there is more to life than working and making money.  Sure, it's good to have money to be able to buy things.  I realize everyone needs money to live but having enough to get by with is all I need.  I do not need tons and tons of money or possessions to be happy.  A lot of people I know have a lot of money but they are not really happy.

However, when she moved in I had just been diagnosed with  breast cancer and she went through the surgery with me and then I just started getting every bug that came along...my resistance was so low from the radiation treatments.  Several colds, bronchitis, on and on, and I think she just started to get bummed out that I was sick all the time.  She had just nursed a dying husband, so she was sick of people being sick.

229575,"Wisdom, responsibility, and my spiritual welfare are my most important values in my life. I know that I gain wisdom from God, who allows all events and situations. I try to value God and what He desires above everything else, but I do fail at this daily. However, I value that he loves me and is patient with me. This is very important because my life would have no purpose without my relationship with God. I value seeing events and circumstances as all under his control. I then gain much wisdom from seeing my life from his perspective. I realize my own inadequacies, weakness, bad habits of thinking of people and the world. I am selfish, and I value God's wisdom to see my own selfishness so that I can grow spiritually. This is related I believe to my value of taking responsibility. Every day I must be responsible to do what I need to do when I need to do it and for the right reasons. This means going to bed on time so that I am not worn out the next day but productive and able to be responsible with my tasks. I equate responsibility with my relationship with God to do the tasks he gives and to be responsible for my thoughts, trying to be unselfish and wise always. I cannot do it without God. He helps me daily.","A week ago I rode my exercise bike for 30 minutes, lifted my 10-pound weights, and took a shower. I do this every other day, so I know I have done that throughout the week.

I acknowledge that dishonesty has become deeply inbedded in our culture.  In the past I found my self telling socially acceptable lies to get along.

237658,"One of my most important values is veganism. I believe that animals should not be treated like they are ""less"" than humans, and that speciesism is one of the only motivating forces for the way people treat animals. I do not eat meat, dairy, eggs, honey, or refined sugar. I also do not wear animal products and yes, that includes leather. I think it is important to be as aware as possible about the consequences your actions might have for others and to be sensitive and caring about those consequences. Because of that, I am against animal testing. I have seen photos of some of the horrible things done to animals for experiments (many of which are not all that necessary) and can hardly understand why my species does these things.  /  / Another value of mine is that I am pro-LGBT rights. That means I do not think that who you are attracted to or how you identify your gender should affect how you're treated or what rights you have. While it is a privilege to be in the majority, I feel that it is wrong to make life harder for those who are not. /  / I also am very critical of psychiatry. I find that the current model of ""healing"" for survivors of sexual abuse or any kind of torture/trauma/etc takes responsibility off the abusers/criminals/terrorists/etc who caused the person's traumatic event to happen in the first place, and places it solely on some nebulous enemy called ""mental illness"" that it makes no sense to be angry with. While I understand that being angry is hard and painful, I think we need to be upset about the fact that rape/torture/sexual violence/assault/ritual abuse/etc are such widespread problems in our culture. I also dislike the way that literally everything is considered an illness. Even having a really disagreeable personality makes you ""sick"" according to psychiatry. In many cases, psychiatry legislates morality. If you are asexual and do not believe sex is important, you have hypoactive sexual disorder. If you believe in magic or the occult ie: spiritual things ""normal"" people don't believe in, you risk being labeled as delusional. It gets difficult to draw the line between labeling to help people and labeling to enforce social normativity.  /  / I believe in rights for disabled people and understanding for their needs.

Too often people are worried about being judged, or seeming foolish, or stupid, or ""uncool"". I love hearing someone speak freely, with no apprehensions, it's a beautiful thing.

257565,"I believe it is best to treat others as you would want to be treated.  If a person is nice, trustworthy and respect then they deserve those same characteristics from you.  I believe a person should try their best at everything they do.  They must value themselves.  If a person loves oneself, then they are able to spread that love to other individuals.  I believe it is best to show people compassion and love.  We are all human beings and none of us are perfect.  I believe it is best to make smart choices that reflect your spirituality.  If you are participating in an activity that your God wouldn't approve of, then you shouldn't partake in the activity.  I think about if my parents would approve of me participating in an activity and then decide if I should not conform to peer pressure, but instead think of what my parents wanted for me.  I know that sometimes peer pressure will overcome my decisions, but I try to not let it.  The best things in life are family, friends, wonderful experiences with family/friends, caring for others, spreading knowledge, love and helping those in need.  Some people are not as fortunate as I am so it is best to help those who are not as fortunate whether it be giving them valuable experiences or even having a nice conversation and acknowledging that they are here in this world.  I believe it is also best to value animals and care for them properly.  Treat animals with respect and train them appropriately.  Animals can offer a lifetime of companionship.

There are values that I have that have been made more important in my life than I would give them under different circumstances. For instance, I am frugal, but that is not by choice or intent, rather it is because I have no choice but to be frugal based on my job, where I live, etc. Another thing that I value is kindness and understanding of other people. I believe that some people make assumptions about others that may not be true and use those assumptions as justification for being harsh or punitive or hurtful. I don't believe that being hurtful to others is acceptable and it is something I try to avoid. I believe that each person has something of value to offer the world and that we can learn from every person that we meet.

292411,"A primary value of mine s to give people a chance.  Even if I find someone to be odd at first, I am nice to them.  It takes someone doing something negative for me to change my attitude.  However, if I am pushed that way, I'll go as far as doing something drastic if I feel the situation calls for it.  I don't let people push me around.  If someone messes up once, even twice, okay.  More than that and I will retaliate. /  / I also try to have an open mind about most things.  Religion is a big example of that.  If someone is religious, no matter what religion, that is fine with me.  I am Atheist and I tend not to make a point of it or tell them why they are wrong.  Only if I am pressed by someone forcing their beliefs on me, then I will get all scientific on them. /  / I am liberal-minded.   I feel that some people are dealt a bad hand in life from the start and need help to dig out of whatever hole they are in.  Even if it is their own fault I realize some people need help.  I only become impatient or stop caring if that person keeps making the same mistakes over and over again.  I have needed help quite a few times in my life so I am empathetic about such situations.

Later that night my friend whom's apartment I was at came running to me crying and hugged me, saying his grandma is dying.  So I told him a lot of things like how he is a brother to me and it makes me sad to see him sad.  I went home the next day and found out that his grandma had died.   So he had a different kind off day.  He saw one of his best friends get married, then he found out his grandma was dying. /  / This past weekend I went on a date with a girl.

I also teach my children to look at both sides when arguing or debating who is right or wrong. I tel my kids to look at the other side and it will help them realize why that person thinks that way or behaves that way. I also teach my children to respect other ideas and cultures as it makes lives richer. They don't have to like that way of doing something but they need to respect it.

308383,"I only have a few values in my life that really stand out to me which I think make me a unique human being, but I am very proud of these. First, I don't believe in lying to people under any circumstances. I am a very honest and up front human being. If I don't agree with something someone says, I will speak my mind. Some people don't like this, but I don't care, as I refuse to bend the truth. Next, I am very strongly drug-free. I don't believe in illegal drug use of any kind for recreation. It bothers me on a very deep level when people I know smoke marijuana, for example, and despite anyone else's opinion on the subject, I choose not to associate with anyone who does any kind of illegal drugs. Next, I put every ounce of effort I can into make sure I am a reliable person that keeps my promises. If I tell you I will do something for you, I insist on keeping my promise. If you need me to pick you up, I will. I want those close to me to know that I can be relied upon to lend a helping hand or be entrusted with important information. Lastly, and this one is very important to me, but I love and adore animals and I strongly believe they should be treated with the same love, care, and respect that human beings are treated with. We are all we have in the world, and I believe in letting them know we care about them as much as they care for us. To go hand in hand with this, I am also adamantly against any kind of hunting for sport. Animals are not pawns in a game for our personal enjoyment, and never in my life will I partake in any kind of hunting for sport.","Woke up, eaten breakfast, eaten lunch, eaten dinner, got dressed, taken a shower, taken a bath, brushed my teeth, combed my hair, shaved my face, shaved my pubic region, put on deodorant, went to the gym, worked out, sweat, went in the sauna, talked to my trained, worked with my trainer, called a friend, spoke to a friend, listened to music, went for a walk, lifted weights, went out to eat at a restaurant, visited with family, talked with family members, hugged family members, kissed family members, called my girlfriend, visited my girlfriend, hugged my girlfriend, kissed my girlfriend, had sex, went to the mall, bought a watch, bought new clothes, bought a suit, went out for breakfast, went to the casino, played blackjack, played roulette, played slot machines, played poker, went online, surfed the internet, browsed on my phone, taken pictures, texted my friends, texted my girlfriend, helped my friend build a chicken coop, fed his chickens, played with his niece and her toys, hugged his niece, went out for fast food, went to the movies, watched a movie, reviewed the movie online on my phone afterwards, downloaded music off of iTunes, downloaded a movie off of iTunes, tried on my new suit, tried on my new watch, took a nap, watched my favourite television shows, watched a hockey game, watched a baseball game, went to a baseball game, bought a hot dog outside from a street vendor, put condiments on my hot dog, ate my hot dog, checked the weather on my phone, bought train tickets, took the train home, visited my grandparents, talked to my grandpa out sports, talked to my grandma about her day, went for a jog, found my umbrella in the basement of my house, drank a bottle of water, drank a glass of juice today",1,3,White/Caucasian,English,2,9,v,315,30.8,97.09,19.69,13.65,80.95,64.44,21.59,16.51,12.06,1.59,0,1.27,4.76,2.54,0.63,1.59,18.41,0.95,17.14,3.49,0.63,1.59,6.35,0.95,4.76,0,6.67,0.32,1.59,0,0,0,0,0.95,2.86,7,High,5,6,High

I make sure my house is clean and inviting just in case they want to come by or have friends at my house. I also make sure that they are fed, clothed, clean, and most importantly, HAPPY every day of my life. It is crucial to me that when they are older, they look back and say that they were happy. They want for nothing and enjoy life to the most possible capacity. I sometimes suffer, but, they won't have to as long as I am around. I am also guided by the principle of the quote, ""cleanliness is close to Godliness"". I clean everything in my house every day and will do so until I am dead. Even if I get an actual job and no longer work at home on the computer, I will continue to keep my house immaculate. I do this because it is a very important part of childhood to be able to enjoy a stress free, clutter free, and healthy home. If I were to wake up one day and find myself unable to do the things that I do around the house I would immediately call a health professional to fix it. I feel that strongly about it.

It might sound strange to someone that doesn't have a connection to God the way I do, and I know I'm not perfect or special, but God does speak to me. Sometimes I will pray for an answer and ask God to show me in the Bible where to find the answer and I'll get the Bible and turn to a page and there is the answer. Only God can do that!

The courage to do whats right and to face whatever life throughs your way and to stand up for what you believe in and be proud of who you are. Always try to do the honorable thing, never kick someone when they are down and do you best to be there for people when they are in need of help, for example if you see someone being attacked or laying passed out on the street, don't walk by and ignore it, help your fellow man even if its to call 911 and report the incident, it is the honorable thing to do.

I value my neighborhood and the friends I have here.","During the past week, I have cooked meals for my husband and myself.  I have kept my house neat and in order.

342741,"The most important thing for me is to pursue knowledge and use my intellect to navigate life. Other than that, I am obsessive compulsive, so my OCD is the most important guiding force in my life. If something is going to set me off, I have to avoid it or find a way to comply with my OCD. I feel that we are living in a society and as such we should all behave in a fair way towards each other. It is very important to avoid committing dick moves, such as cutting in line or traffic, taking something that isn't yours, harming a person in any way if they haven't harmed you at all, et cetera. With this fair nature of things, I also believe in exacting revenge or obtaining reparations if you are wronged. Forgiveness is important, but a person should only forgive someone who has wronged him after an appropriate revenge is taken or after the person in the wrong has apologized and made amends. Indignant persons who wrong you unapologetically should be dealt harsh revenge in order to teach them that they must be fair in their relations with others.","On most days I followed the exact same routine.

349762,"I believe in equality, not one of us is any less than any of us.  We all have a right to live our lives in freedom, but with that freedom comes responsibility.  We must ensure that there is opportunity for all, we must each be responsible for our own lives and choices.  We owe it to each other to make good choices, to help one another, to protect our environment, to share resources, to attempt to understand and forgive each other's mistakes.  I try to live my life by looking for the good in others.  I look for the uniqueness that each one of us has, I look for the spark, for the humor that each of us contributes to any interaction.  I try to be a listener more often than a talker.  I look to constantly learn new things. I take responsibility for my errors, I am not afraid to make or admit a mistake because I view it as an opportunity to learn.  I am humbled when I hurt someone, I try to tread lightly so as not to hurt anyone or anything.  I believe in the sanctity of life, I would have a very hard time going to war, I do not feel that fighting and killing one another is a way of solving any problem.  I try to live each day, appreciate the beauty around me.  I believe in a God, a higher power that we are all accountable to.  I do not believe any one religion has a lock on God but that he is in each one of us and we can only benefit from looking for Him and listening to Him in everything around us.  I realize the older I get, the less I know and that others are capable of doing things just as well as me, if not better.  There is no one way to do anything and there are some really clever people in this world.  I continue to have hope for the human race.","This past week has been devoted to worrying and caring for my mother-in-law.  At age 92, she suffers from mild dementia and appears to be getting worse.  I try to spend time with her every few days and often my husband and I alternate days so that someone is visiting her almost every day.  I also try to talk on the phone to her but it is getting more difficult as she has more and more trouble recalling the words she needs for conversation.  She is in an assisted living facility and is well taken care of but she does not want to be there.  It is so hard for my husband and I to see how age has ravaged my mother-in-law.  She has always been a wonderful person, she would never complain and was always the first to offer help.  She now is scared and confused. She wants nothing more than to see her mother, who has been dead for more than 40 years.  She doesn't always recognize the people around her, she is often confused and it breaks my heart daily.  I would say, this takes up most of my thoughts.  But, like everyone else, I do the normal things of life.  I walk daily with a good friend for both exercise and companionship.  I take care of my home, I spend time with my husband and I keep up with my grown children.

Self-discipline helps me to get through times of struggle when I need to get thru challenges. These usually take care of most problems, but there are some problems that can take a long time to overcome & I need that something extra to persist with these problems. This is where spirituality comes in. I don't adhere to a specific religion, but Buddhism & Hinduism would come closest to my beliefs. Meditation and prayer have helped me cope with some of my biggest problems. Self reliance really helps me to do things on my own so I don't have to rely too much on others to get tasks done or to resolve my problems. It has made me a stronger person mentally & physically. Finally, in getting along with others I try to treat them as I would be treated so I try to be nice & have fun with other people. It doesn't always work but it does work most of the time.

382830,"My basic value which guides my life is based upon soul wisdom and knowledge, soul memories about who we are which is that we are spirit, eternal beings who take a memory veil to focus on enjoying and experience life in the physical world we call Earth. Further that our physical sense are like a radio set, they only have certain channels we can experience life but around us if we use our inner gifts like intuition, inner vision or inner feeling we can begin to detect an energy field around us that has life - that has beings who live on this energy field which is alive with consciousness. And I believe as we continue onward into our future the door or entry to these other dimensions is getting smaller and smaller. Further, when we sleep and our waking consciousness goes to sleep, we join this other part of us which exists on other dimensions and we have experiences there which when we awaken into this physical world we may remember as a strange dream or not at all. I have had so many experiences of this contact with the spiritual part of ourself, that I do not believe this is true, I know it. And furthermore, Creator is all of us, and we are Creator or we are all one - that means every other person is a part of me and I am a part of them which is why to some degree when I meet other people I can feel a sense of who they are without any words - so how this knowingness affects me is that I can alone everyone else to be who they are, whether I like them or not, their soul has choosen the earthly personality to go though lessons of life and I must respect it. Further, I see myself, following and living these core philosophies as an example (outer) of what is possible within each of us and thus at times, I know I help other people to know themselves better.  There are no mistakes, everything that happens is in divine timing and for each of us to grow and learn.","I am helping to organize a special event in November, something that has never happen before - to create a time when people who share a special interest in the crystal skulls will meet each other so I have been helping a team of people to create this event and sharing information on-line about the current status.

I also watched the hockey games of the team they might face as well.

It's very easy to know what the best decision is at every given moment. We live in a world though that for the most part someone else has tried to instill their values into us. So when we make decisions based on what is right or wrong it's usually done from a platform that we did not create ourselves. Some could say that altruism does not exist. Isn't self fulfillment easier than any kind? But how long do we stay satiated from that action? / Good things can come from self fulfilling actions, but ultimately I truly believe that each and every creature on this planet has been created for a certain purpose, and ultimately that purpose derives around serving others. It's very hard for myself to fulfill my need because I love to control everything, or at least have the impression that I have the control. The irony is that there really is little that we have even a semblance of control over. I am moved by actions of people that act out of dignity no more really though than I am by the actions of people that are atrocious. Adolf Hitler intrigues me as much as Mother Teresa. Mimicking Mother Teresa would actually be much harder though because it would be taking the moral high ground, something that produces more fulfillment than any other act. Unfortunately my basic values were not embedded into me as much as they should have as a child, but  I also believe that as an adult now I have absolutely every opportunity, tool, resource, and enough abundance to provide a great life for myself and as many others as I would like to provide for.

I teach in a school with a very high poverty rate, and a very high population of English Language Learners so the ingrained empathy and sympathy has helped me to make connections with many of these students.  I am known for always volunteering to help colleagues and to step in wherever I am needed. /  / Not thinking or saying anything positive about myself has been a struggle.  When I do something well, or I do receive some sort of recognition, I am very uncomfortable sharing this information with anyone, and I especially cannot share with family.  I also am uncomfortable sharing positive things about my children with my family.  As a result of this, I never hear that anyone that I am close to is proud of me or happy about what I have done.  This has made me LAVISHLY hand out praise to those I am around. /  / From these two things, I try to live me life being as nice and and helpful to others as possible.  Even if I am angry or unhappy, I still strive to be nice and polite.","For the past seven days, I have been very busy.  Last Monday I went to work and spent the day working on getting my classroom ready to close down for the summer.  I also spent time rehearsing with my eighth grade choir for their final performance of the year.  Monday night, I went with my family, and my 14 year old son's best friend to see my son recognized for being a member of the honor society.  As we were there, we realized that my son's friend was supposed to get an award as well, but he did  not know.  After the ceremony, we went to sonic and got shakes and went home. /  / Tuesday, I continued to work shutting down my classroom and rehearsing, and that evening dropped my son and his friend off at the movie theater to see Godzilla.

My biggest immediate goal in life right now is to finish my doctoral dissertation within the next two years and to basically land a full-time job. I am somewhat stuck in life as a poor graduate student and I need to start moving on with my work and doing better than I’ve already done before in my life. I need to help my family financially, as they are in a difficult situation. I also need to save up enough to move out of my parent’s house and move in with my loving boyfriend. I want to do this as quickly as possible – but it’s hard with a dissertation committee as slow-moving as mine is! My central values are in being as loving, kind, generous, and yet firm as I can be. I am committed to helping others but not ever to the point of sacrificing my happiness. I am committed to being the best person I can possibly be, and to lead the happiest life I can. To that extent, I do not privilege physical pleasures or material goods. I choose to find happiness in the good work that I do in my field of study and to find happiness in the loving and supportive relationships I build with other people.","I often went to go to a walk every single day and really enjoyed myself in that way. I would walk around my neighborhood and visit all the cats, including the beautiful long-haired black-and-white cat. I went past my neighborhood church and enjoyed the beauty of its magnificent spires. I said hello to my old friends at the graveyard. I went to the library and enjoyed the books there. I wandered among the garden of beautiful, lush, yet dying roses in the local park. I threw pennies into the local park's fountain. I logged to Amazon turk to make some money every day and am trying to support myself this summer without teaching in that way. I drank any, many cups of tea, green-tea, that I have bought before. I ate carefully and tried to portion out my calories. Ramadan is coming and I'm going to have to at least fake fasting and it's really annoying the hell out of me to have to do that.

Mostly what I need is to be doing something interesting or creative, and to have friends that love me and want me around. Oh, and also food. Food is important. Delicious satisfying food. And I like to be active, which these days means walking or going for a fast ride on my bicycle. In the past I ran for exercise but I hurt my foot and have been healing for the last several months. It's nearly healed up, though. For creative activity, I write, not that you can tell from this stream of consciousness example. I'm working on a novel and a bunch of short stories, and when I'm done I will share them with the world and hopefully people will respond to them. I just want to be noticed for doing the things I enjoy. I like to travel but that costs money. Seeing the world and meeting different kinds of people makes me happy. I try not to hurt anyone else, and I try very hard to not judge others for believing or enjoying different things than myself. I've worked hard to make empathy a core value, and I shun anger and angry people. I try to reserve anger for when powerful people hurt or oppress the less powerful, like minorities, the poor, or those with less social status.","I normally get up at 8 am, and the first thing I do is make breakfast. My breakfast consists of coffee, ground daily from local beans; 2 or 3 strips of bacon, and an English muffin with butter. Most days I'll also include a half cup of plain yogurt, flavored with honey. While I eat my breakfast I also read the news online and catch up on email and Twitter; I do this in the kitchen. Then I move to my computer in the living room and try to get some work done. Work consists of writing, either on the novel I'm working on, or, lately, doing online tasks like this survey for Mechanical Turk. Around 1pm I will go out for a walk and to get some lunch at one of the local restaurants, then walk home again. While walking, I listen to music or podcasts on various topics and think about what I'm working on. At least three times a week I like to go for a bicycle ride, 10 miles or more, for exercise. This is my standard day. Last Sunday, I went over to a friends' house; they cooked a big breakfast and had many other people over for breakfast and company. I stayed there until late afternoon, and it felt good to get out of the house.

399567,"When it comes to values, I find many to be of importance. I try to demonstrate the values that are important to me, to pass them along to my son. I try to practice respect to everyone, no matter what the other person says, does, looks like or anything else. Respect is something that is overlooked a lot of times. I believe to have respect for others is something we could all do a little more of. I also believe in forgiveness, this can be challenging, but in the end it saves a lot of stress and hard feelings. I also feel it is of utmost importance to protect plant and animal life, and the earth in general. I know that's a touchy issue, but I feel a strong sense of commitment to the natural world. I do not drive, and this is possible because I work from home and live in town, so anywhere I need to go I bike or walk. I also save power when I can, I try not to be wasteful. I volunteer by cleaning up trails, cleaning litter. I recycle on the regular. I try to teach my son how important all of these things are, and that it can be said it is a human duty to protect and respect the environment. I believe in equality, I think this is a major issue in our country. I think social equality is by far the grossest example of things we need to change. The income in this country is disgustingly distributed. Far too many people in America work so very hard, yet struggle just to get by. It is so sad to me. Another value I think is important is to own up to your mistakes. You'll never learn from them if you can't admit them and confront them.","Last Monday, my son started swimming lessons. All week last week, we went to the YMCA for his lessons, from 11:20 to 12:00 each day. Before and after his lessons, I worked on my Transcription job from home. He had a friend come over on Thursday, and they had a great time. At the end of each weekday last week, when my husband came home from work, we had a good time getting outside and enjoying the summer weather. We went for walks and bike rides, and did some yard work. Each weekday last week, I had my son complete a series of worksheets, so that he does not lose any valuable education time during the summer. I had him complete three each day, each of a different subject. He is also required, by me, to read for at least 20 minutes each day. Most of the days, I let him read silently; one day last week, I had him read aloud to me, because this really helps his verbal reading skills. Last weekend, we borrowed a truck and spent most of it in the mountains. We took our mountain bikes up trails, and had such a fun time! We even found a rather large garter snake when we visited a nearby stream. Yesterday, we went for a good long hike. We saw a moose, but our peaceful hike ended up getting ruined by some jerks on four wheelers. Nothing ruins our hikes more than loud engines, and people tearing up the trails. Not to mention, this is illegal on the trails we were on. Anyway, after the four wheelers left, we enjoyed our time in the mountains. We discovered a number of old abandoned mines, with old buildings and interesting things. We spent a good five hours on this hike, and that was extremely fun for all of us.

If we can remember that everyone deserves to be treated more fairly and justly, then I think that we would all respect each other more and get along better with one another.

I try not to lie, though it can be super tempting, on a daily basis. I don't steal, period. I always try to be empathetic towards others. I feel like, you never really know what any random person is going through. Empathy, now that I am thinking of it, may be my second strongest guiding source. When I am faced with difficult decisions, I always think first, of the repercussions of my decision. Mostly, whether, or not it affects others, and if it would be in a negative form, I try to lessen that. I tend to be an extremely empathetic person, others usually come first for me, it does not matter if I must suffer, so long as I can lessen the impact for someone else, I guess that's because I feel maybe I can handle it better than they would. Often, I think of what the elders that I aspire to be, may do in a similar situation. I guess, I just live my life for others.","I took my daughter to a splash pad, so she could play in the water on a hot day. We have barbecued almost on a nightly basis for the last week.

One that I've recently implemented is the realization that I as a human being must be kind to all others and do my part as human being to make this world that much better. I've realized that there are things more important then money and a 9 to 5 job. What I realized is Id rather work for myself so I can be able to create the time to spend with important people in my life like my children. You never know when life will end so it is important to spend time doing things that make you happy and try to avoid things that or mundane or that make you miserable if possible. At the moment I am currently trying to create a life that will allow me that kind of time. ,"Within the past week my days have been somewhat monotonous.

454131,"I'm a humanist.  For me the central guiding moral values are compassion, rationality, respect for people's right to self determination and a concern for the well-being of humans and animals.  When it comes to questions that are controversial today, like gay marriage, my point of view is that it should not be regarded as wrong unless it clearly does harm.  Gay marriage does no harm so there is no reason, according to my principles, to be opposed to it.  I'm also interested in meta-ethics.  Why, for example, is it ""better"" to value the well-being of others and not just my own?  I'm inclined to believe in the idea of intrinsic goods.  Friendship, love, compassion and similar values are, as best I can tell, intrinsically worth valuing.  A sociopath might disagree but it seems to me that such a person is missing out.

I also picked up a jar of chocolate covered raisins for me to bring to work to snack on. After costco I went home and read to pass the time until my husband got home.

I stayed home from church so that I could try to sleep some more. After my husband came home from church, we started cleaning the house a little because family dinner was at our house this Sunday. My husband ended up taking a nap, so I started making dinner without him. I got the first batch of pizza dough done, and then my husband came and helped me to knead the dough.

I would always choose family first. Then around 30 I had a breakdown due to abuse I suffered as a child and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. This has caused me to be weakened and reach for a higher power to guide me through. After regularly attending church and studying the bible I began to understand why people say God first. Because if we are focused on God and what he thinks of us, how he loves us and how he wants us to behave we become more God centered. More of Him in us and less of us. That dynamic makes us less self centered and more other focused. This has made me a better wife and mother. When I am feeling crabby or unhappy or upset I try to remember God's desires for me to live a good life and to love others above myself. This often helps me re focus on those around me and forget my needs. Now I'm not saying I neglect my needs in fact in order to be healthy we must care for ourselves first and make sure we are meeting our needs.

481490,"The guiding principle of my life is rather corny but it goes back to my days in Sunday School and that is to treat others as you wish to be treated. I believe in being honest. If I screw up or do something to hurt someone's feelings, I apologize. I believe all people should have a fair shot at achieving success in their lives but I also believe that ultimately it is up to the individual to take responsibility for his actions and put forth the effort to succeed. Life is not fair and neither is it equal but I believe that if people really take responsibility for their own lives and become independent adults, then they will be successful. Success is not measured by the cost of your house or your car but the freedom you have to make your own choices and whether you are happy. I would rather be happy than rich any day of the week. I believe in helping those in need and frequently give money to homeless people I see and this is money that I really can't afford to give but I've been hungry before and I hate to see people miserable. I believe in protecting the weak. I also believe in standing up for what I believe in. If other people don't agree with me that is fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. We can agree to disagree but if I believe a cause is just, I believe that this is one of the greatest benefits of being an American and that is to disagree with others and stand up for what is right.

I have quite an inner conflict because while I want to be this way I also have little tolerance for people who push others around. i will lash out at those people in defense of others.  Health is the most important thing.  I try to respect nature and living things and teach my child to do the same.  To be kind first but also to be tough and respect yourself.

I don't like phoney people and have zero tolerance for those who base their self worth on what they own and look down on those who don't have as much.

490366,"There is a lot of things that guide my life value wise it is hard to pin point all of them, but here are some off the top of my head: /  / 1. Honesty, I believe in telling people the truth and expecting the same in return. This especially true with friends and family. I want to be able to trust people and to have that happen they must be honest at all times so I know I can rely on them. I am brutally honest with people too, I don't like lying about the way I feel or something that happened. /  / 2. Caring- I care for a lot of my friends and family when they are in need and I would expect the same with them. To care for people shows you love and support them and that is really important when maintaining relationships. I especially care for my husband and the family he has brought me into. /  / 3. Trusting- there are so many aspects of trust it is hard to go in one directions. But you cannot have anything happy in life without trust. If you can't trust someone you worry all the time and waist prescious life waiting away worrying about the what if's. Being able to trust someone relieves a lot of things in life. /  / 4. Love- Where would we be in life without love, love is what makes me want to wake up and do stuff every day. Without love I would have no reason for living. Love brings happiness and ties into honesty, caring, trust and pretty much everything else in life. /  / 5. Working hard, I think everyone should work hard not only in work sense but also in life. If you want something you must work hard to get it and be willing to show people how much it really means to you by doing everything you can to get it and maintain it. This especially true in relationships we have to constantly work hard to keep the love there and to keep caring, trust and honesty. These things aren't always natural they have to be worked at and as long as you really want it you will have it.","5/29/2014 this day I had off work because I was getting a new glass eye made and it was the final steps to getting it done.

513591,I believe in doing the right thing in every situation.  I believe in being truthful even if in the beginning it maybe a lot harder and even cause hurt feelings and conflict.  In the end I believe the other person will respect you because a lie maybe easier but in the end a lie will always be found out and then you may lose a friend and if not at least the respect of the person.  I believe our family and doing for them is why we are here.  I believe that things work out in the end and that the good and the bad one does comes back to them in some shape or form.  I believe that you never quit just because something gets hard because nothing that comes easy is usually worth having. I believe you should never stop trying to learn and that you should teach people what you can that can help them.  Not to be afraid to ask for help and also never shy away when someone ask for help.  ,I get up every morning get ready to go to work I let the dog out to pea try to decide what is for dinner and start it if necessary.

It is very important to be honest with people no matter how bad the truth may hurt or cause an inconvience. Being independent is the second most important value in life. I know that everyone needs help sometimes but for the most part ons should be independent of others. One should always have respect for others but most of all respect themselves. In most cases if respect is given then it will also be recieved but there are some cases when respect isn't given back the way it should be, but its best to remain true to yourself and respectful to others in these cases. One should be willing to sacrifice for the benefit of their family, especially their children. One should always be respectful to their parents and elder member above anything else.

The first and foremost value is to be kind to others and have a positive attitude. Always speak in a positive and gentle way to others especially my wife. Another value that I carry is to be loyal to your family. This is my most important value that I learnt growing up. The reason why this is the most important value that I learnt growing up was because my father neglected his family and care about others above his own family. Even though he was able to somewhat provide for us, he didn't care about our mental state of mind. This is important for a human being growing up. So, this a value that I learned the hard way.  / Another value I have learned is to love thy neighbor as thyself. This is a difficult value, but also important.

526414,"One of my guiding values is seeking happiness and harmony in life.  Happiness can be found in so many places if it is sought, and harmony makes life much more peaceful for all involved.  I also tend to seek pleasure in life, and enjoy seeking new adventures and fun rather than ""success"" or wealth -- I have been called a ""medium chill"" type of person or a modern day ""hippie"" and I am ok with both of those titles! Money and a 60 hour a week career does not hold a candle to happiness and freedom.  Ask any 90 year old and they will often wish simply for more time on earth -- in other words, they will rarely wish that they had worked more hours to make more money. I adore my spouse, friendships, family, and relationships, and they are held in higher esteem for me than material possessions.  Likewise, intelligence and a great sense of humour are more important to me than outward appearances -- there are many people who are beautiful on the outside, but there is often a shortage in those who are beautiful on the inside.  My other guiding value is my concern for equality.  All people should be treated equally, and they should all be given equal chances in life.  Open mindedness and creativity, along with a compassionate nature and a sense of humour, is what I value most of all.  ","One week ago, on Saturday of last week, my spouse and I did some home improvement. We worked out in the garden, got some vegetable and herb seeds growing in our little greenhouse, and did some plumbing -- we hooked the water hose up by soldering some pipes together.  Then, we tilled the backyard a bit to get it ready for future planting. After that, I made a pasta dinner for us and our best friend, then the three of us watched a hilarious movie called Pumaman.  While watching the movie we had a delicious yellow cake with chocolate frosting.  After that, my spouse and I showered and went to bed for the night. On Sunday, my spouse and I slept in, then we went into the kitchen, ate breakfast, and did some cooking together. We were preparing a cauliflower pizza and fallafel for my Mum for mother's day. Mum and Dad came over, and the four of us sat out on the deck around a fire, drank absinthe, and ate as we celebrated mother's day. The four of us also played an old game called Pizza Party. When Mum and Dad left for the night, my spouse and I went in to the house, cleaned up the dishes, and took an early shower so that we could relax together on the sofa. We played Odin's Ravens, a board game, then played some Siren: Blood Curse on the PS3. We also played some Child of Light while we snacked on popcorn and coffee.   /  / On Monday, my spouse and I woke up early, got ready for work, and carpooled in to work together.

At about 6:00 pm we headed home for the night, stopping off at our favourite coffee shop (Boston Stoker) on the way home.  When we got home, we met my Dad for a movie -- Rifftrax's Supersonic Man, and ate potato chips with him -- kept him company while Mum went off to a volunteer meeting. After that my spouse and I came home, showered, and did some of our usual hobbies. I painted and did some drawing. /  / On Tuesday, we carpooled in to work again, and met for lunch at noon. This time we played Hive during lunch. I had to meet with a new client at 3pm, and then at 5:30 pm we carpooled home.  This time we stopped at our other favourite coffee shop, Winan's.  We played the New Nancy Drew game on the computer as we ate dinner, then my spouse learned Ruby while I did a bit of baking and made a pair of earrings. We talked about a possible job cage, took a bath together, and went to bed.  /  / On Wednesday we woke up, carpooled to work, and again met for lunch. This time we played Hera and Zeus.. Then, I headed home early so that I could stop off at the market, get some food we needed, and make dinner for us.  I picked my spouse up after work, and we played more Nancy Drew while we ate -- finishing the game. We watched a little Scooby as we worked on our hobbies -- I did some metalwork this time. I also worked on a story that I am writing.  Later, I went in to the greenhouse, watered the plants, and did a bit of gardening with my spouse. Then we showered together, got lunch ready for the next day, and went to bed.  /  / On Thursday, we carpooled in to work, I met with a new client in the morning, and my spouse and I met for lunch at 1pm. We played cribbage with our zombie board, talked about work, and planned a trip to see Rifftrax live in Minnesota this July. We carpooled home that night, ate dinner out on the deck, and put on some 80s music while we ate and talked.  When we went back inside, we put Evil Dead while my spouse programmed and I worked on some writing I needed to finish. Then, I played some Siren: Blood Curse before we headed in to take a bath together.  I also spent some time browsing the web for a new shirt, then we went to bed.  /  / On Friday, my spouse and I carpooled in to work, took some time to stop at a breakfast spot on the way in, and decided to eat outside for lunch since there was a covered patio we found near work. We met for lunch, talked about weekend plans, and played cribbage.  I also talked to our best friend about meeting him for breakfast on Saturday morning. We both left work early, stopped off at a coffee place (Boston Stoker), then went for a hike near a waterfall area.  We then went home, did a bit of gardening, and I got dinner ready for us. I tried out a new recipe, and it was surprisingly good!  Then we watched a new horror movie on Netflix, snugged on the sofa, and ate popcorn.  Then we bathed and went to bed. /  / Today we woke up late, which felt amazing, took an early morning shower, and headed to our friend's house for breakfast -- we brought half of the food, he provided the other half.  We put on some jazz, drank coffee, and talked about work and life in general.  At about 2pm my spouse and I left so that our friend could get to work.

527116,"Treating people with kindness and compassion has always been a central guiding principle in my life. No matter where we come from or what we are going through, we are all deserving of having someone treat us kindly.  I have often sought out opportunities that allow me to be of service to others, through employment, through volunteerism, through day-to-day interactions.  People don't deserve our pity - they deserve our empathy and support.  I DO NOT believe that this value comes through simply because people consider themselves to be religious. In fact, I have often found that those who consider themselves the most pious are the least likely to lend a hand - unless there's some sort of accolades for their efforts.  I have never found an organized religion that speaks to the complete giving of one's self to other beings.  Vowing to honor and support a god who is not visible in our lives doesn't help humankind.  I extend this courtesy to all living creatures who share our planet - they, too, deserve kindness, compassion and understanding. Hypocritical people infuriate me, as do self-centered and mean-spirited individuals.  I DO believe that karma is real and that these people will eventually get what they've got coming. The universe is interconnected and amazing!","Each day, I wake up and go to the YMCA - some days it's to do training walks, some days it's cross training.

My daughter had a band concert which was exceptional - they played a variety of movie music and showed clips from the movies as the kids played.

It allows me to understand others and accept them even when I don't agree with them. It means that I'll be more capable of realizing that my beliefs may be totally wrong. Forcing myself to do that makes me a lot more thoughtful than I would be. I think it makes me a lot happier and it makes my relationships with others much better.,"Last Monday: I woke up at 8 in the morning, which is 15 minutes later than I normally wake. I made a cup of hot chocolate, grabbed a banana, and 5 strawberries. I took my medication. I opened my computer and read an article from The New Yorker. I don't remember what it was about. Next, I worked on mathematics for around three hours. I'm visiting my mother. We decided to take my baby brother to a carnival that had come through town. Before that, we went to a local bar and grill by the name of Sancho's. Sancho made three vegetarian tacos for me. I got a headache while we were at the car and went to the car to lie down. After about 30 minutes, I got up and read from Perversity Think Tank by Supervert and Love In Infant Monkeys by Lydia Millet. Dinner was a large spinach salad with sriracha sauce and italian dressing. /  / General outline of my week: / I wake up at 6:45 am. I got out of bed and had a breakfast which consisted of a variety of fruits and one cup of hot chocolate. Next, I read an article from The New Yorker and did a quick check of Twitter for about 5 minutes. I got dressed for exercise and went on a 30 minute bike ride. After I returned, I attempted to meditate for 20 minutes. I took my medication. Next, I worked on mathematics for 3 to 4 hours, depending on how much willpower and energy I had. I prepared a quick lunch. After lunch, I would have taken a 20 minute nap. After the nap, I read some of Milan Kundera's book Immortality (my favorite book) and skimmed over Harper's Magazine or Huffington Post. I am still visiting my mother and would walk to the bus stop (Tuesday - Friday) to pick up my brother. We went for a brief walk together. I returned to the house and did an hour of work on mTurk. Then I prepared dinner for everyone, which is usually a vegetarian dish. After that I put on amber glasses and went into a dark room in the house (I'm doing dark therapy).

I really look as to what I am going to leave my children when I die.  I want to leave them more then money and wealth.  I want to leave them being known as the children of a caring family.  I am willing to sacrifice something that will hurt me as a individual but help my family in the long run.  My values come a lot from my parents and past experience.  I believe that is where most values come from because you are raised by their beliefs and you choose to follow them or not.  I use these values and principles to see that it is truly about family.  Family is the one that if your in trouble or hurt you can always go back to them no matter what.  Family can understand each other and have an understanding that you can not gain through a friendship.,"Work Work Work,  Working 12 hours a day on Thursday and Friday and sleeping between shifts did not leave much time to do anything else.  Saturday involved myself and my daughter going grocery shopping together to purchase items for our Memorial day cook out coming up.  On Sunday the family and I woke up for the RI Air show.  We spent all day there watching the planes.  On Monday as a family we went shopping again at Home Depot for yard items.  We also worked in the yard cutting the grass and cleaning it up.  We went to the local park to hang out with my wifes cousins wife.  That night I worked at the fire department.  On Tuesday I worked again the yard planting in the garden with my daughter.

530489,"In all things of importance I pray about them. My most important values are those described in the Bible. I try to follow what is written there. I think of myself as a Christian and try my best to do what is pleasing to God. Of course I am human and sometimes I slip and do the wrong thing or say the wrong thing. When I realize that I have opposed my values I feel guilty and ask for forgiveness from God. I believe that life would have no meaning without God and the Son in my life. A life without faith, is no life at all. I believe that I owe so much to God and the Son and I want to do what is pleasing to them. I strive to take the moral high road in all things. When interacting with others I try to be patient and understanding. Sometimes it backfires, but not everyone has the same values as I do. This discourages me at times. When it does, I again turn to God in prayer and I feel renewed. I seek the word from the Bible to help me to know how to live. ","In the past 7 days, it is hard for me to remember everything that I did. Mostly I got up every weekday and went to work. I stayed at work for 8 hours and did my job as a Medical Records Technician. I brought my lunch everyday and ate it in the lunchroom with coworkers. After work, I would come home and cook dinner and eat it with my significant other. After dinner, I would wash dishes. I would do laundry if needed. I would also do some light cleaning around the house. Then I would sit down in front of the TV to relax and watch some of my favorite shows. A couple of times after work I went shopping either at Walmart or at the grocery store. Then I would come home afterwards. Sometimes after I came home I would call my daughter, just to keep in touch and find out how she has been doing. Sometimes after I came home after work, I would go outside and water the lawn or do some other lawn maintenance. Other times after work I would go online and look for mechanical turk hits to do. Sometimes I would just go online to surf or to logon to Facebook and see what my online friends had been doing lately.

531249,Since life stings and then you die I have long seen helpiing others to find some meaning and enjoyment in life to be an altruistic goal. Of course there is little satisfaction in not being able to provide real answers but I wanted to be kind and loving and strove to be understanding and emphathetic and compassionte of the problems others faced. I viewed life as something we all struggled through and we all needed someone who could make it just a little easier to work through. When I reached my mid 20's I found those goals to be less satisfying than when I wasyounger. I guess by the time you are 25 or 30 you have endured enough suffering that you really want meaningful answers. I started looking into Eastern religion because I was unhappy with so called Christians but I accidently discovered that true Christianity is indeed very satisfying. It just is not common. All mainstream churches have been corrupted and donbotreally teach the bible at all. / Finding out what the bible really teaches along with why it is to be believed has given me a new set of values and guidance for my life. I feel closer to God and continue to have compassion and concern for my fellowman at the sametime. So my values from teen years and early 20's have not changed that much. But they have been enhanced and matured by adding values from the bible and having the reason or explanatin for why theworldis the way it is along with knowing the eventual solution to mankind;s troubles as well as the future for the earth. And it is not bleak at all. Of couse there is a time like right now when it seems bleak but ultimately things will be better. This contributes to me being a more positive person but still concerned with helping others endure life.,You guys are nuts.  / Most of my timethe past 7 days has been spent working.I work with a developmentally disabled man. My job is tohelp him / learn life skills such as washing hishands and using a napkin. I help himwith enunciation. I help him with social interactions / and how to make simple purchases at a store. Things like that. I enjoy spending some time nearly every day bible reading. maybe only a few verses but then I think about them and how they apply to me or my life and others. I try to find an encouraging thought in the verses. I also enjoy playing basketball for some time each week. I spend time with my wife and sometime with friends and at religious meetings.  ,1,7,white,english,5,5,v,318,35.71,88.87,21.2,19.5,72.96,59.75,13.52,7.86,5.35,0.63,0,0.31,4.09,1.89,1.89,0.31,18.87,1.57,17.3,5.97,2.2,1.26,1.89,1.89,4.72,0,8.49,3.14,2.2,0.94,0.31,0,0,0.31,4.4,5,High,3,5,High
532204,"One of the values that drives me is the desire to be honest in all situations. I never realized how difficult this is when other's feelings are involved. Little white lies are acceptable in our society, but sometimes they grow into bigger lies. This got me to thinking about how many times a day we lie. When I began taking note, it was astounding how frequently we are deceitful in one day! /  / The other thing that drives me is that we live in a self-centered world. I discovered that the times I felt most fulfilled have been when I have been reaching out to others. Even when helping others, we become self-absorbed with how ""good"" we are for helping so and so. To be truly self-less is daunting, but do-able. The Bible says that when we help someone, or do something for another person, the left hand should not know what the right hand is doing. Basically, don't toot your own horn. Forget the part you played, instead experience it as part of our life work. See that we are here as part of one body, which has many parts. When we function in our ""call"" it is for the sake of others, not a narcissistic purpose. The Bible also says that when we draw attention to our own good deeds we have already received our reward. It is a very small reward compared to the bigger reward we could have obtained.","Tuesday June 17, 2014: /  / I got up at 6am and smoked a cigarette / I made breakfast for my husband and me / loaded the dishwasher / watched the news / took a shower and styled my hair / made a cup of coffee and smoked a cigarette / started work around 9am / took a break at 12pm and had lunch / my son called me around 12:30pm and we talked for about an hour / went back to work at 1:30pm / my husband called me around 4:30pm to let me know he was on his way home / made dinner around 5:30pm / watched the news / watched television until bedtime which was around 10pm /  / Wednesday  /  / up at 6am and made breakfast / ironed my husband's clothes / smoked a cigarette and had a cup of coffee / watched the news / started work at 9:30 am / put a load of laundry in at 11am / back to work until 1:30pm / my husband called me during his lunch time / back to work around 3pm / made dinner at 5:30pm / attended Bible Study at 6:15 - 8pm / stopped for ice cream at Sonic / home around 9pm / watched tv til bedtime which was 10:30pm /  / Thursday /  / slept in until 7am / ate breakfast alone / smoked a cigarette / watched the news / started work at 10am / lunch at 12:30pm / paid bills  / started work at around 2pm / mowed the lawn around 4pm / cooked dinner at 5:30pm / went to walmart to buy groceries around 6:30pm / came home at 8pm / watched recorded shows on tv until bedtime 11pm /  / Friday /  / awake at 6am and made breakfast / smoked a cigarette and drank coffee / watched the news / cleaned both bathrooms / laundry / vacuumed and dusted the whole house / started work around 12pm / made dinner 5:30pm / watched tv all night til bedtime around 12 am /  / Saturday /  / awake at 8am and smoked a cigarette / cleaned back yard / weeded garden and watered all flowers and vegetables / had coffee / went to Home Depot to buy a shovel and rake / made lunch around 1:30pm / had a political discussion with husband about Iraq and Iran / washed the windows around 4pm / ate dinner 6:30pm / went to drive thru movie around 8:30pm / arrived home around 11:30pm and fell asleep /  / Sunday /  / awake at 8am / ate breakfast / went to church around 9:45am / lunch at home around 1:30pm / went to visit grand daughter / back home around 9pm / bedtime 10pm /  / Monday / awake at 6am / made breakfast / smoked / started work 8:30am / lunch at 12pm / work  / made dinner around 5:30pm / watched the news while eating dinner / watched tv until bedtime which was at 10pm /  /  / ",2,5,Hispanic,English,3,5,v,242,10,94.35,15.13,14.46,76.45,62.81,20.25,11.16,3.31,6.61,0,0.41,10.74,7.85,2.07,0.83,18.6,0.83,17.77,4.55,2.07,1.24,1.65,1.65,7.02,0.41,4.55,0.41,1.24,0,0,0,0,1.24,4.55,5,High,4,5,Low

534905,"The central and most important values that guide my life are at the core being an ethical and compassionate person.  These guiding values are at the core of all of my decisions and how I try to interact with people.  While not strongly religious (I'm agnostic), I do believe in living by the golden rule of treating others the way that you want to be treated.  I believe that all people are equal and that all of us are just doing the best we can to get by in the world and that it's of great importance to make sure to treat others with respect and kindess.  It really doesn't take that much effort to be kind and respectful to the people around you.  What I have discovered is that you tend to get back what you give, so putting more kindness out into the world just brings more kindness back to you.  This is not to say that bad things don't still happen on occasion, but you are far more likely to reap good things if you are good to other people.  And living this way not only makes other people feel better, but it makes you feel better as a person as well.  If you know that you are trying to be kind and do the right thing, you don't have to worry as much about if your actions have hurt someone else, because you know that you are treating others the best way possible.","Most of what I have done over the last week has been fairly routine.

548381,"I think one of the most guiding principles that I live by is making sure that whatever decisions I make, whatever I do or say or anything, how that will impact someone else. If it will impact their lives, thoughts, or feelings positively then I think my actions are good. That's a really important value to me: making sure that I am never hurting someone else, even their feelings. Although sometimes I do, both intentionally or unintentionally. But I know that it's wrong and I know as soon as I do it (most of the time) that it's wrong. As long as I am not hurting others, I think I am doing okay. This principle guides my personal and professional lives. In relationships, I make sure to always be there when teh other person needs me. If I turn down a request from a friend to, for example, pick them up when they are stranded because their car broke down, or to help them move, etc. then I will feel really bad becuase my decision NOT to help them will negatively affect them. it will be harmful to our friendship, and they will have to find another course of action to resolve their problems. That's making their life harder which is negatively affecting them. So I always say yes when a friend is in need (within reason of course. I would hate to be ""used!""). I am also NEVER late when meeting with a friend unless I have a good reason. I also will send a message to let them know I'll be late and that I'm sorry. My time is not more valuable than theirs. And it's disrespectful, and thus negative, if I choose to be late. I think the same value can be applied to a greater scale. So long as one person is not affecting another, laws should not be made to restrict that action. Gay marriage, for example. If two men or women want to get married, their actions don't directly OR indirectly affect me in any way. At all. So why legislate against it? The same goes for a ton of other similar situations. Complicated, sure. But a good principle and one that definitely guides my life. ","I took a flight 1 week ago today back to home. I just moved in with my husband.

575819,One of my most important values in life is to treat others as you would like to be treated.  This has been a strong belief of mine since I was young.  I have always tried to be nice to everyone that I have met.  Often this type of behavior has granted me a lot of disappointments.  I have learned that you can't treat people the same and have to treat each person accordingly.  Most importantly I have learned to try and not wear my heart on my sleeves.   /  / Another value of mine is to stay spiriutally grounded no matter what.  Life is going to be filled with challenges and it is up to the individual how to deal with them.  Life lessons can be hard and disappointing but we learn and grow from them and become better people as a result.  If you don't learn from your mistakes you will continue to make them and are destined for a very hard road ahead.  If you beleive in God or another higher power and try to live by their principles you will be just fine.  The principles laid out in the bible will help you make it through hard times and keep you grounded. /  / I have also learned that family is one of the most important values in life.  Without family most people are nothing.  When nobody else will be there for you most of the time you can count on your family and God.  When others turn their back on you your family should be there to lift you back up.  Since a youngster I was always taught not to let anybody come between me and my family.,"For the past seven days I have tried to do things that make me happy and simplified my life.

My spiritual and religious life is the guide to my actions with others and in the world at large.  I know that one of the prime requirements of my faith is to care for the poor and less fortunate.  Am I thinking about myself all the time, or am I caring for others who are part of ""the body of Christ"". /   I try to interact with people with compassion and caring.  I want to be able to love others as I love my self.  No one can do the will of God if they don't put others first.  That is not to say that you neglect yourself, but that you are not self-centered and neglectful of others.  People are an important asset in your life.  They are there because you are able to share with and help them, as well as, they can reciprocate and help you and share with you.  My personal relationships are such that I try to be available when I am needed and be someone who can be relied upon and nurturing.  I love my family and it shows in my actions.  I know my family loves me, because it shows in their actions. /   My prayer life is another guiding  way I am guided through life.  It not only helps me deal with life's difficulties, but gives me peace and tranquility knowing that I have divine help in all aspects of my life.  If I find myself in stressful situations, it is one of the first things I do: turn to God in prayer. /    I find that through the years I have matured about what matters most in my life.  Money and things do not bring happiness.  It is the people in one's life and the presence of a relationship with God that brings one the most joy.

596657,The key thing for me is treating everyone fairly and taking into consideration how my actions affect other people.  That's very important to me because that's how I would like to be treated.  It's how I look at myself in the mirror every day knowing I tried to keep everyone's interest in making my decisions.  It's not always easy to do and certainly other people haven't always given me the same consideration.  But really believe that we should be free to do what we like in so far as our freedoms don't restrict the freedoms of others.  I try to figure out the least harm for all of us and sometimes that means making sacrifices I don't like making but I do it anyway if other people stand to benefit from it.  I think in the long run it's worked for me and some people have appreciated what I do and have given back to me so it's nice when people realize how much I try to keep them in consideration when making my choices that affect other people.,I did not have a car from Tuesday to Friday so those days I stayed in as the condo I'm in right now is about a 40 minute walk to the main road.

I came home to a partially prepared dinner when I assisted my husband in finishing that preparation.  Then we eat together.

To be able to live a lifestyle freely, without having to worry about interference  by controlling people, be it government, not-sofriendly friends, or nosy annoying people. To live independantly enough to where I could or any one in my family could forage, hunt, and gather food should they ever have to. To have a moderate balance of both technological fun and physical/outdoors fun, ie play some video games and use computers but also fish hunt go outside and have fun. To be able to say what I want and make my own choices without having to live the way someone else wants me to rather to live the way you want. To have the things I want and desire, not just scrap by barely making my means. To live in a world where you can have your own beliefs and not have to like people you don't want to or be told how to live in your own land or town. Thats why I choose to not select the equality options, its against freedom to force people to live around people they dont want to. True freedom means you can live how you want with who you want on your own land. If you and your neighbors feel you should be able to build something or do something, then you shouldn't have to have city permits nor let anyone you don't want around. Your life is all you got, and you only get it once so you shouldn't have to fill it with shit you do not want to. Enjoying life is making the best out of what you can, and that means your relationships, your ideals, your everything is and should be up to you.

625980,I find it is extremely important to be honest. Many people do not like to hear what I have to say because I am a very honest person. I do not believe in lying or sugar coating anything. I believe that eventually the truth always comes out anyway so there is no point in hiding it. I also believe that it is important to be successful. I am not a person who values high end objects but in order to be comfortable and content in life you really need to be successful. I do not know too many homeless people that are happy and content living on the street. I value the objects that I do have but would like to live comfortably without having to worry about bills. Call me crazy but I like electricity and running water. I also value my family. I am in a line of work where I see people at their absolute lowest every day. When people do not have the love and support of family it makes life very difficult. I am lucky to have a family that loves and supports me and is there when I need them. Spending time with my family alone can help me talk through problems and understand that I do have a good life even when I am struggling. I believe that it is important not to judge other people's beliefs. Everyone has some sort of belief about something and no one has any right to tell them that their way is wrong...maybe they think that your way is wrong.,"On Sunday I went to my mother's home for dinner and then went home and slept.

639989,"It is easy for me to ascertain what my values are.  My first value, my highest priority, is in living out my Christian faith, and it impacts everything I do.  Living out my faith impacts my own personal character because it requires me to study Scripture and try to discern what it really means in my life.  It requires me to be honest with myself about what I need ot change and to rely on God's power to help me make those changes.  It requires me to seek God's guidance daily, even hourly, through prayer as I go about my every day tasks and chores.  It requires me to forgive others as I have so greatly been forgiven and to not judge others, but to show grace in every circumstance as much as I am able.  It requires me to love others, even when they are unlovely, and to freely share my resources--money, time, and talent--with those who need it, starting with my family and radiating outward into my church, my community, and the rest of the world.  When I see a person in need, it is my faith that encourages me to reach out to him or her and offer help. When I need to decide how to discipline my children, it is my faith that teaches me to temper justice with mercy.  When I am faced with a difficult task, it is my faith that drives me to do my best.  It is my faith that taught me to treat my body well through healthy eating and exercise.  It is my faith that tells me to treat others with respect no matter how they treat me, and no matter how I feel that day.  Without my faith, I would not be who I am today.","Wednesday of last week, I awoke early, ate breakfast, showered and dressed, woke my kids up, and drove my daughter to her ballet class.  While she was in class, my sons and I went grocery shopping, and then we went back to pick her up.  We picked up lunch on the way home, stopped at the house so the kids could brush their teeth, and then went to get their teeth cleaned.  After the tooth-cleaning, I took my daughter to the orthodontist.  Then I took my boys to music lessons.  I picked up dinner for my kids from a Pizza Hut Express, then took my older kids to youth group.  While they were there, my youngest son and I went to the bookstore.  When it was time to pick up my older two, we got the, then stopped at Starbuck's for a treat before driving home.  Once home, I got the kids settled in to bed, had a glass of wine, worked on mTUrk for a while, and then brushed my teeth, changed, and went to bed. /  / Thursday morning I woke up, worked out, had breakfast, and then proceeded to make a schoolwork schedule for the kids for that day. (We home school.) Afterward, I responded to some email I had not seen the day before, cleaned out the sink, unloaded and re-loaded the dishwasher, and did a load of laundry.  I woke up my kids, made them breakfast, and showered and dressed. I dried my hair and applied make-up.  At that point, it was time for my kids to begin work, so I started them on their work and then did some mTurk HITs.   After about an hour,it was time to get lunch ready, so I prepared lunch for all of us while emptying the dishwasher and moving laundry from washer to dryer.  We ate lunch, and I read some news stories on-line while doing that.  I checked the mail, and I got my kids back on-task for the afternoon.  While they were working, I took a short nap, and then I folded laundry.  I put the laundry away and emptied the trash.  Then I spoke with my husband on the phone about when he would be home from work.  I read some more email, checked the snail mail, and then began preparing dinner.  The kids and I ate a hurried dinner and then rushed over to my youngest son's karate class.  While he was in class, my older son and daughter and I walked around the neighborhood.  After karate class, we got a snack at McDonald's and then drove home.  I told the kids to get ready for bed and then did some more HITs on mTurk.  I talked to my husband briefly about what he wanted to do for Father's Day, brushed my teeth, put on my pajamas, and went to bed. /  / Friday morning I woke up as usual, worked out, ate breakfast, showered, dressed, dried my hair, applied make-up, and woke up my kids.  We did our usual morning schoolwork, ate lunch after I prepared it, and then went to the pool at a nearby YMCA.  While the kids swam and played, I watched them and sent emails and text messages from my phone to various people regarding school, church, and just catching up.  When the kids were done in the pool, I drove them home and cooked dinner.  After they had eaten, I took them to the store to buy Father's Day cards and gifts for their dad.  Once everyone was satisfied with their choices, we went to the YMCA to work out.  I drove us home, where my husband was waiting for us.  We all watched some TV shows from Netflix.  Then I put the kids to bed, changed in to my pajamas, did some HITs on mTurk, and brushed my teeth before climbing in to bed. /  / Saturday I did my usual morning routine, minus the workout, and then I went to the grocery store.  I spent an hour at Kroger buying enough food for the next week, and then I came home and put the groceries away.  Once that was done, my husband and kids wanted to go to Costco to get some bulk batteries and look for video games, so we drove to the nearest Costco, stopping for lunch at Steak N Shake on the way, and spent another hour there.  I also took my daughter to the shoe store next door to look for shoes, but we were unsuccessful in finding her something.  When we got home, it was time for dinner.  I peeled some potatoes, pre-heated the oven to cook rolls, shucked some corn, and seasoned the steaks that my husband would grill.  While my husband grilled and my kids played outside, I cooked the corn, rolls, and potatoes and opened a bottle of wine to let it breathe.  Once the steaks and sides were done, we sat on the patio and ate dinner.  After we ate, I cleaned up the dishes and put them in the dishwasher while my husband chatted with a neighbor and the kids played outside.  Since it was late when we were done outside, everyone went to bed soon after coming inside. /  / Sunday morning I got up, showered, dressed, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, dried my hair and applied make-up.  Then I got everyone else up so they could get ready for church.  The kids and I all gave my husband his Father's Day gifts and then got in the van to head to church.  We were visiting a new church for the first time, so on the way there, we discussed what we were hoping to find in a new church.  We found the church, parked, and went inside where we talked a little bit with some on the church members.  We discovered that one couple there knew the pastor from our former church, so that was a pleasant surprise.  After the worship service, we chatted a little more with the pastor and his wife, and then we headed to lunch.  My husband chose the nearby Chinese buffet for his Father's Day lunch, so we went there and enjoyed a nice meal.  After we finished there, we drove to a local bakery for dessert.  Then we drove home, where my husband collapsed on the couch for a nap.  The kids and I were bored, so we loaded our swim gear and headed to the YMCA pool for the afternoon.  While the kids swam and played at the pool, I napped and read a book.  Then we headed home.  My husband had had a good nap, so we decided to grill hamburgers and hot dogs for dinner, which we ate while sitting on the patio.  After dinner, we cleaned up our mess.  I let the kids play video games while I did a few HITs on mTurk, and then I told everyone to get ready for bed.  We all went to bed early that night because we were exhausted. /  / Monday morning I awoke at 5:00 am so I would have time to prepare for the day.  I exercised first thing, then showered, dressed and ate breakfast.  After breakfast, I checked email and news, and then I prepared my kids' schoolwork for the week, checking out resources on-line and making lists of what they each needed to accomplish.  At 8:00, I wakened my kids and made them breakfast.  AS soon as they were done eating, we got to work on school.  The work load was light for them, so I did some HITs while they worked.  Everyone was finished for the day before lunch-time, so while I prepared lunch, my daughter cleaned her room, my older son practiced guitar, and my younger son began trying to clean his pocket knife of rust. I poured some vinegar in a bowl for him so he could soak it, and we chatted about an experiment we had done a few months ago that proved that vinegar was a good cleaner.  Once lunch was ready, we all ate quickly so we could run errands in the afternoon.  Our errands included a trip to the mall to buy exercise shoes for my daughter and then to get haircuts for all the kids.  Driving to the mall was a pain because the traffic was all backed up, but once we got there, we enjoyed looking at all the stores.  After looking for shoes in two stores without success, my daughter and I finally found a good pair for her at the third store.  I paid for the shoes, and then my older son asked to look in Radio Shack for a 12-volt battery.  We went to Radio Shack and asked the lady at the counter for the battery, which she gave us.  Then we browsed for a few minutes until everyone was bored.  We left the mall and drove to e nearby Great Clips so the kids could get their hair cut. I checked them in on my phone, drove to the salon, and sat there while they got haircuts.  I paid, making sure to leave a good tip, and then I drove home.  We had a quick dinner of leftovers and decided to give my daughter's new shoes a workout by going to the YMCA. We drove there, used the weight machines and ellipticals for an hour, and then drove home.  When we got home, I sat down to do some HITs while my kids told their dad about their day.  All of a sudden, I heard my youngest son say, ""Ouch!"" I asked what happened, and he showed me that he had cut himself while cleaning his knife.  We cleaned the wound, put ointment and a bandaid on it, and then I called the advice nurse to see if he would need a tetanus shot.  It was a small cut, but I had to spend 30 minutes describing it to the nurse while my husband put the kids to bed.  Finally, the nurse said that my son was due for a tetanus booster anyway, so we made an appointment to have the shot the next morning.  I wondered why she had asked all those questions if he was due for a booster anyway, but I guess she was following protocol.  I went back to doing HITs while sipping a glass of wine.  Then I got cleaned up, changed into pajamas, and got ready for bed. On the way to bed, I threw some clothes in the washer, hoping to remember to dry them in the morning before I left. /  / Tuesday I overslept.  When I finally woke up at 8:30, I immediately got showered, dressed, and ready to go before bolting a quick piece of peanut butter toast for breakfast.  I started my coffee brewing and roused my cranky kids as quickly as I could.  As they dressed, I checked email and the weather forecast,  threw the wet laundry into the dryer and then I tried to do a few HITs.  There was no time for schoolwork before we left, so I rushed the kids into the van and headed to the doctor's office to get my son's tetanus shot.  We got to the facility about 10 minutes early, but we couldn't find the office.  I finally asked a security guard where to go.  He pointed me to the check-in, and we stood in line for 5 minutes waiting our turn.  The lady at the check-in told me that I had a balance from a previous appointment earlier in the month, but I had the receipt with me because I had not cleaned out my purse since then.  We shared a laugh about the benefits of being a slob, and she pointed me to the doctor's office where my son would get his shot.  We got to the waiting area about 2 minutes late, and I was glad it wasn't worse, considering our late start.  While we waited to be called back, we looked at the fish in the aquarium and read the posters about exercising on that were hanging on the wall.  The nurse called my son back, took his vitals, and showed us to the room. The doctor came in, examined the cut, and told us there was nothing to worry about. The nurse came back in to give my son his shot, and I told him to look the other way and take a deep breath, which he did. We left the office, got in the van, and drove to a nearby Chick-fil-A for lunch. After ordering at the drive-through,  I drove back home, tried to get my kids on task for school. and did some more housework--laundry, dishes, sweeping, and cleaning the counters.  Amazingly, my kids worked really well all afternoon, and I checked their work before making dinner.  Dinner was a quick affair, consisting of whatever I could find in the refrigerator.  As soon as we finished eating, it was time for my son's karate class.  I drove him to class and then went to the grocery store with my other two kids.  After shopping, we had a few minutes until my son was done with karate, so my daughter tried to show me how to knit.  I was a miserable failure at it, but we had a good laugh at my efforts.  Then I got my son from class and drove home.  Once home, I kissed my husband hello and made sure he had found something for dinner.  I told my kids to get ready for bed while I did some more HITs.  Finally, I tucked my kids in and got ready for bed myself.  However, I wasn't tired enough to sleep, so I did a few more HITs before finally crawling into bed after midnight. /  / This morning I woke up at 6:00 and made myself some breakfast.  I ate, put on some workout clothes, and exercised for an hour.  I sent some emails to friends and family, and I made plans to get lunch with my good friend in two weeks.  I let my kids sleep as late as they wanted because there was not too much work to do.  They all slept until almost lunchtime, so I went ahead and made lunch for them after they got up.  After we had eaten, I did a few more HITs and made them start schoolwork, but they all finished their work in less than an hour.  I decided to take them to the park, but when I went out to the garage, I saw that my right rear tire had a bubble in it.  I called the tire shop where we had purchased the tires and made an appointment to get them looked at tomorrow.  I called my husband to tell him what was going on, and I told my kids the bad news.

","The last seven days have been very much out of my routine, as my husband and I recently purchased a travel trailer and moved into it.  Almost all of our activities have centered around solving the problems we have run into with the trailer, which has turned out to need a good deal of repair before it was suitable for my husband to live in.  My husband has end stage renal disease and is on dialysis, which we do at home through peritoneal dialysis.  This means that we must have a sterile area which can be sealed from any contamination, as well as hot water to clean with.  Unfortunately, it turns out the plumbing in the trailer leaks in many places.  Repairing this plumbing has required numerous visits to the hardware store to get the correct parts, then to trade those in for the REAL correct parts.  At the same time, we were moving our possessions from our former rental house to the trailer in a small car, as well as storing many things in a storage building we also rent.  A few possessions had to be given away or sold.  While doing all of this we had to maintain my husband's routine of dialysis every four hours during the day (four exchanges, four hours apart, each lasting about 45 minutes).  My husband also volunteers at a computer lab and it was necessary for him to continue that obligation.   /  / On Thursday we drove the 150 mile round trip to Las Cruces for my husband regular monthly blood tests and clinic visit.  While there we also did our laundry as the laundrymat there is much cheaper than here in Truth or Consequences, and filled the car with gas since gas is also about 25 cents a gallon cheaper there.  We saw my husbands temporary nurse, as they are in the process of hiring a new nurse.  He had blood drawn and we did some continuing education. /  / The whole situation was complicated by the event called Fiesta here in Truth or Consequences, NM over this weekend - Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  This occurred in a park that is midway between the two homes so that we also had to contend with a great deal of traffic, and tourists who are often quite lost.  We did go to Fiesta ourselves on Saturday, walking from the trailer to the park.  We listened to and danced to the band Casual Fridays for about half and hour, then stopped to visit with some other volunteers from the computer lab who were manning a booth.   /  / Sunday we moved the last few things out of the house and cleaned it.  We left two large desks outside the old house as one was being given to the computer lab, and we were going to take the other to sell for scrap metal.  However, the maintenence man wanted into our cabin to paint - so once we finished cleaning he was able to do that. /  / Monday we took the metal desk to sell for scrap metal.  My husband left later to take the wooden desk to the computer lab.  I stayed home and worked at the Mechanical Turk since we finally had things hooked up so we could do that.

I walked his dog in the country, and generally relaxed and enjoyed myself in a situation where I have no responsibilities.   /  / I've completely confused the days and activities.  They are more or less in the right order, but to tell you the truth, I can't tell you exactly what I did on any one day.  Normally I have a daily todo list but it, of course, is packed and now misplaced.  On a normal day, I get up, have a pot of coffee, meditate, do yoga, and then check my email.  I help my husband with his second dialysis exchange (he is an early riser, so he does his first before I am awake).  I have a light meal.  I work on the Mechanical Turk for a few hours, or if there are no jobs available for me to do I write or draw or edit my own work.  About 3 pm I break and have another light meal and a walk, bike ride, or kayak depending on the weather.  By 4 pm I am back at the computer writing, drawing, or editing or publishing my own work on Kindle - after helping my husband with another exchange.  Around 7 pm I stop working for the day and my husband and I watch ""tv"" or a movie, which we always watch on the computer.  Sometime between 7 and 10 we generally visit with the friend I mentioned earlier via video chat.  About ten pm we do my husbands last exchange and then I take care of his bedtime activities.  I stay up until about 2 am most days.  I alternate reading, and watching anime during my little bit of free time, although sometimes I will write or draw.  At various times I spend one or two hours per day studying Japanese.   /  / Tuesdays is ""white tornado day"" when I give the house a thorough cleaning with bleach cleaner and disinfectant, including things like scrubbing the toilet and shower, and washing the floor.

On Friday, I also had to work, this time from 12pm to 8pm. After work I went with a coworker and a friend to see some local bands play in another friend's basement. On the way we got a case of beer. At the show, I saw a lot of people I knew and had a good time. I drank beer. After it was done, me and my friends got a pizza and went back to their house to hang out. It was kind of late and everyone was kind of tired so shortly after eating me and a friend got a ride from another friend back to my house. My friend slept over and we cuddled in my bed. He tried to kiss me but I told him not to, I just didn't feel like it. In the morning he left to go to work around 11am. I went back to sleep for another hour or two. I made plans to day drink with one of my friends, but I really didn't feel up for it. I texted her at around 3pm to see what she was doing. She said she was at the mall and I felt relieved that I wouldn't have to do anything for a little while at least. I spent the day sitting in my room watching Gossip Girl and smoking weed. My friend texted me around 7pm to say she had left the mall and could hang out. I didn't respond and planned to text her in a few hours to say that I had fallen asleep. I watched more Gossip Girl and smoked more weed. At around 9pm, I texted my friend and apologized for not texting her back, I told her I had fallen asleep. I had told another friend that I would go to her birthday party that night so also around that time I began getting ready. I cried once while trying to get dressed because I felt like none of my clothes look good on me anymore. I told myself I was being dramatic and continued getting ready. At around 11pm I got to the party. All my friends were already there. We got drunk and danced a lot. It put me in a better mood. At around 2am me and some other people went to another friend's house. We hung out there and made food and watched music videos. I left around 5am and went home and to sleep. I woke up at 11am on Sunday, I had to be at work from 12pm-8pm. After work I went home and changed quickly then got a case of beer with one of my coworkers and hung out at a friends house for a little bit. I got bored and went home around 12am. My coworker came with me and slept in the guest bedroom at my house. On Monday I didn't wake up until 2pm and I felt awful about it. I had made plans with one of my best friends but I felt so tired. I told her I had to help my mom for a few hours to buy some time. I went out to get coffee at Dunkin Donuts then went back home and forced myself through a shower. I didn't feel like doing anything. At around 5:30pm I told my friend I was done doing stuff and she came over. We bought a bottle of wine and went to her dorm room. Its summer so all the rooms were empty. We went into every single one of them, just to see. She found a mirror that someone had left and took it. We texted our friend who worked near by to see if wanted to hang out, as it was now 8pm and his shift was just ending. He agreed and we met him at his work. He drove us to his house, which is also where a lot of other friends and my best friend's boyfriend live. We got very drunk and danced. It was fun. Around 12am I went home because I had to work the next day. On Tuesday, I woke up at 5am, I had to be at work at 6am. I worked form 6am until 10am. After work I went home and sat around and smoked weed and watched Gossip Girl. At around 12am I got sad for no reason so I texted a boy I met on the internet and flirted with him until I felt better. at around 4am I went to sleep almost but then I realized a boy I met in Michigan a few weeks ago was on tour with some band. I checked to see if there was a stop on the tour in the town I'm in. There was and I really hoped he would hit me up about it. I decided I'm going to go to it regardless of if he tells me about it or not because it's at a bar and I could just pretend it was just chance I was there. Then I fell asleep.

Showing compassion in a responsible way benefits the receiver, the giver and society in general.  Caution is to be taken to not let one factor outweigh the other.

One can't help others & society from a position of weakness, but an eye should always be towards the greater good. I believe that our world contains enough resources for everyone to have enough, but not for a small percentage to have an obnoxious abundance while others struggle to survive.  The uber wealthy need to realize how much is Enough, and share a proper portion with those who work for a living.  Without the workers, the factories are just buildings with machines.

However, I also have a very deep emotional side that tends to make my heart interfere I with my head.  If a situation is relatively calm, I find it important to be cool and controlled and make sure everything is in its place and as it should be, but when something is chaotic enough to arouse my emotions, I let passion guide me.  Passion isn't a value on its own, but it turns other values into the guiding stars that blind me to logic and thought.  I believe the highest in love, in God, in the heat of anger and the ice of fear that I feel inside me sometimes, because those are honest, those are instinct, and those are something I have not spent time talking myself out of for the sake of stone-cold logic.

Love in this case means that I am to look for the good in people and encourage them to strengthen their positive qualities. Second Chores. I am to do something that needs to be done.  Third Others.  I am to benefit others. My businesses are to benefit the investors, the clients, the employees, myself and our families. Fourth Mind I strive to be wise. When I was younger I broke this into aptitude, attitude (at that time it meant emotional wellbeing) history (because of the cliche` that states that if you don't know history then you are doomed to repeat it) and current events (because if you don't know what is happening now, how do you know whether or not you are repeating history) Fifth  Body. Be healthy. When I was younger I emphasized exercising for strength, endurance and flexibility then joked that my entire life might need to be lived with this in mind. The other components of the body dealt with nutrition and hygiene. And sixth, Self. This was a reminder to enjoy life. What difference was it going to make if everyone else was happy or I attained someone elses ideal of success, if I was depressed and wanted to die.","I opened the coop door to allow the chickens to graze in the yard.

The next day I moved furniture around so that she had a bedroom to sleep in with the kids. And so they all would feel comfortable.  I usually work on turks each day and exercise and dog walk but the whole week I didn't do any of that. Helped her take care of her kids and buy them the things they needed.

Although you should never be unkind, you should also never be blunt.  Lying to others is not a form of behavior that is acceptable.  Also you should not take something that is not yours and you should not try to take advantage of other people.  You must respect people's differences and try to give them the benefit of the doubt.  You should help others out, but also trust your gut.  This means that if you see someone by the side of the road and want to help, but have an uneasy feeling in your stomach, then you should trust the uneasy feeling and not help out because your safety is important.  You can't ever take back mean words that you have said so you should choose your words very carefully.  A moment of anger can lead to years of heartache and hurt feelings.  You should be as independent as you can.  Although it can be good to rely on others for help when you need it, don't take advantage of their kindness.  Expect others to care for themselves as much as they can.  You need to realize that sometimes people need the experience of failing so that they can learn, so even if you could help them out, it might be better to let them stumble.  It might seem cruel at the time, but they will be more independent for it.  If you see someone being hurt, then step up and defend them.  These are proaba    ","Okay so I woke up and fed the children.  I got my youngest dressed and off to summer school.  After he left there was house work.  After that I went to work and worked a long hard day.  My husband dropped the kids off at the babysitters.  After that lather rinse repeat everything until the weekend.  On the weekend got up really early and helped everyone get ready.  Went and picked up my mother in law and we all went to the farmer's market in the city.   The farmer's market was big.  The first stop off course was to grab everyone a crepe sweet or savory our pick.  After eating the crepes then we go and grab produce.  Everything is so fresh.  There are a lot of peas and brassicas.  You also get to try lots of different foods like homemade salsa and bread.  The produce goes into the cooler and then we check out the vendor stalls.  There is jewelry and pottery and lots of other craft and art items.  I grab a bracelet to add to my ever growing jewelry collection.  Each kid is given a few dollars and gets to pick what they want.  After the vendor stalls it is time to go back and get lunch.  Spring rolls and meat on a stick with a plate of sticky rice, there can't be anything better out there.  After eating lunch we throw our trash away, gather everyone up and go home.  We drop off my mother in lawa nd then go home and rest and I begin preparing dinner.  On Sunday we sleep in and then go to the afternoon church session.  The kids don't like how stuffy the chapel is so we go out in the foyer.

701943,"My most important values are social justice and equality. I do not believe in hierarchies of people, and my ideal world is one in which people are respected for who they are, who they've been, and who they want to become. I think mutual respect and listening are good starts to finding out about the equality of all people and peoples, and I believe that modeling these behaviors, along with developing a vocabulary of radical equality are ways to break down traditional modes of society. It is time to move beyond simple detente with false dichotomies and acknowledge the breadth and depth of human experience. Equality does not mean that we all are or should be the same - it means that we deserve equal treatment before the law and in the face of social institutions. I believe that it is important to take care of yourself and others as we move toward a vocabulary and praxis of radical equality, because self and immediate community form the basis of larger and even global communities. If we do what we can for ourselves and those closest to us, we can move all agendas forward. It takes a serious commitment, but the alternative - the status quo - is both undesirable and untenable.

I found out early last week that my friend Amanda had an interview at my place of work, and I helped her prep for the interview throughout the week. This week, one of my clients had surprise announcements that made work especially difficult, as I had to rearrange my schedule to make sure I had time to give all my clients. On Thursday, Amanda had a cookout at her place, after which I helped her pick out an interview outfit and then talked more about the position. Yesterday, one of my clients was rumored to be settling a very large lawsuit, which made yesterday especially stressful. After work, I saw Amanda and we talked about her interview, and then I went to see my lover again last night. We had to wake up early today so he could get back to town to work.

Its not good enough to simply be uninvolved, to take only a tangential interest in others and what they need/share. When i spend time with a friend, for example, its not enough to simply be present, i want to do better/more. Often times this becomes a matter of attentiveness to his or her needs, truly listening, and in the context of any given interaction doing my best to provide advice, support, ideas, or humor and companionship as appropriate in the interaction. this belief in fairness, sharing, and attentiveness is core to my self image, and in a way, mindfulness, is also core to my spiritual beliefs.  /  / Another core value is fairness, and being non biased. When i judge and react to others, it not only hurts them, it hurts me be closing my awareness/mind to new experiences, new insight and perspectives i may have gotten for myself but for my being closed to the experience. So when someone tells me of an experience, be it spiritual, emotional, or something in their daily life, i don't brush it off as uninteresting or wrong. I try to feel and see, what it is they feel and see/saw/got from the interaction.

There are too many people going around in this world grabbing for all they can get and judging other people for having a tough time and getting government money and then calling those people ""lazy"". That's horseshit. Living below poverty is not easy nor is it fun. Be kind to people and be generous if they need it. No one needs shit like a matching curtains in their room or two cars or whatever if others are barely scraping by. Nothing impresses me more that generous people.

737432,"One of my most important guiding values is the Kantian categorical imperative. This means that in every interaction with others I try my hardest to treat them as humans rather than as objects. The categorical imperative focuses on a good will as the ultimate, non-instrumental expression of the good. Thus, people who follow it must always make moral decisions treating humanity as an end rather than a means. How exactly does this translate to daily life? This is a hard question for fans of Kant. For me it mostly involves reminding myself that people are not objects, that they are all complex and well-meaning people who are just trying to understand the world around them. I think this makes me a lot less cynical than I normally am. This way of thinking reminds me that I am no better than the people around me, and even though I am smarter than most of the people around me I must still treat them as equals and as humans, rather than as means to my ends","The past seven days have mostly been boring because I am on summer break.

If you're not honest, you'll dig yourself into a deep hole and leave that hole alone without anyone trying to help you out of it. Another one of the values I believe in strongly is to leave the past in the past because that's where it belongs. I have a habit of thinking about missed opportunities or things I should have done differently. There is no need to dread on any of that. You have the time that you have now and there is no way to get back any of the time you've loss. There's no use to be mourning over a close one that died over 5 years ago, because being sad isn't going to bring that person back to life. SO I guess another important value to me is Happiness. You are in control of your happiness, and no one else can take that from you unless you let them. Happiness is important because you never know when it's your last day. There is no need to go through life sad or depressed because this is YOUR LIFE. Why waste it on sadness? I wouldn't. ","This week I did a variety of things.

I think everyone who is employed should do the job and not slack off or break rules, because if they would prefer that-- they should quit and make room for a new employee. I believe people should not mock those with down's syndrome, and never use the word ""retard"" as an insult. I believe people's sexuality is their own business and therefore unless I am interested in dating/having sex with someone it's not my business whether they're gay or polyamorous or whatever else. I believe in marriage as a contract between two consenting adults of any gender, creed, or blood disorder. I believe everyone should pay the same percentage of taxes, especially the rich with their tax cuts since their 35% is so much more than my 35%. I believe abortion is a decision best made by the pregnant woman in question, and her chosen doctor, not to be determined by politics or religion held by others. I believe the purpose of life is to leave a positive mark during your time here. I believe there is no one true religion and that religion shouldn't enter politics or government in the slightest.","Last Wednesday, I have no idea what I did specifically. I do not remember Thursday either. Friday I got an e-mail from a person that I rented a room to back in January. I talked to my husband and responded to the email. Got an e-mail back, responded again, got a response. My husband's friend came over that day. I used my computer for several hours. I drank some beer. I had sex with my husband and we went to sleep. Saturday we woke up around noon because the old room renting guy had come over to move in again. I drank coffee. My husband and the guy went shopping. My husband brought me home food from Panera Bread. I had half a ham & swiss sandwich and a cup of mac-and-cheese. For dinner I made steak, baked potatoes, and carrots. Sunday I had honey pecan ice cream at some point, that's about all I can remember. Monday, that was yesterday. I had scrambled eggs for breakfast. My husband made a 3D printed item and gave it to me. Today I woke up and made a cup of coffee. I found my bra on the bathroom towel rack and was embarrassed to have left it out, even though the guy who rents a room from us is a cross dresser and probably has bras laying around himself. It was (or is) very hot out, about 90 degrees F. That guy had a date and came into the garage where I was using the computer. I helped him give his date directions on how to get to our house.

I feel like I am committed to these values and that all of my actions in my daily life reflect these values, particularly my choice of occupation and volunteering. I spend Saturday mornings at the animal shelter helping homeless pets, not only because of the benefit of helping defenseless creatures but also to see the joy on people's faces when they are reunited with a lost pet or found a new family member. I also volunteer as a CASA advocate in my local community and  tutor an elementary child for free once a week. I have chosen to live close to my mother as she ages in order to be nearby and spend alot of time with her and help her out around the house, etc. I go over to her house on Monday nights and cook her dinner and also stop by to help her with gardening or house work on Thursdays. I think it's important to cultivate those relationships over time even if it means limiting my career to one geographic location or passing up on advancement opportuntiies that would require me to move. I also believe very strongly in my religion and go to Bible Study as well as mass twice a week. I often stop myself and remind myself that each person is a reflection of Jesus and that I should love each as my brother and sister in Christ. It often helps to remind me of this during frustrating or trying moments. ","A week ago today I was working late because I had alot of tasks that had not been done yet.

743996,"I feel that freedom is the ultimate guiding light of moral fiber. Without freedom, a person is not allowed to mold their own beliefs and morals; without freedom there is nothing but mindlessness dependence. That's not to say depending on others is bad or wrong, but one should be able to form their own opinions about anything and shouldn't rely on others to think for them. After freedom, health is extremely important. To live a long life, you must take care of your body, because it is the only one you have while you are on this earth. Whether or not you believe in an afterlife is irrelevant to this; a healthy body is a happy body. Speaking on freedom once again, it is this thing which allows people to choose how they interact with each other. Sure, freedom allows for negative interactions, but not without consequences. These consequences are what keep people from persuing negative interactions to begin with. I myself try to live as freely and healthy as possible, because these two values are of extreme importance, and are 2 of the rare few things we have complete control over as individuals.","Day-to-day activities that I have done in the past seven days include eating breakfast, playing video games, watching anime, going to the gym, and eating dinner.

801634,"One of the most central values that guides my life is my relationship with God. I have been a Christian for fourteen years. I grew up in the church, and the lessons that I learned in the church have shaped me into the person that I am today. All of my values come primarily from the church, because my parents were very big in the church as well, so they taught me to follow the Biblical guidelines not only by word, but by example as well. I was taught to love and forgive others, to treat others as I would want to be treated, and to care for people who were less fortunate then I was. I will admit that there were times I fought against my values, but I never really stepped over the line where I knew there would be no turning back.  /  / Another value that guides my life is the hard work ethic that my culture taught me. From the time I was young, I was taught that in order to get anything in life, you have to work hard for it. I started doing chores for a few coins when I was around ten, and in everything I've done in life since, I've tried to maintain the same work ethic that I had when I was young (even though it's not always easy).  /  / The third value that I have is one of frugality. Even though I have money, my parents taught me from an early age that just because I had money didn't mean that I got to spend it whenever I wanted, so I learned early on the value of saving a dollar. People might call me cheap, but I figure that saving my money is better then spending it (with rare exceptions).","Last week starting on Sunday, I went to church, then went to a birthday lunch. Afterwards I came home and we all went out to eat for dinner as a family. On Monday, I went to work, and then came home during lunch. I then spent most of last Monday on the computer, except for around 5 when I worked out. I worked out from 5-6, and then took a shower and ate dinner. After dinner I watched Dancing With the Stars, and then went to bed. On Tuesday, the routine was pretty much the same as Monday. On Wednesday, since I had the day off, I ate lunch with my parents before they went on vacation. The rest of the day, I spent mostly at home, and  just rested except for around 3-4 when I worked out. I then drove to Alhambra because one of my friends was having a birthday dinner, so I ate dinner with a large group of church folks, and came home around 11. I then went to bed.

802023,"My most important guiding value is the Golden Rule.  I try to treat others as I'd want to be treated.  This doesn't always work and I'm not always successful at it either.  Sometimes I get annoyed with, for example, a clerk in a store and even though I wouldn't want a customer hassling me if I were a clerk, I know that as a customer, I'm not going to get the treatment I ought to get without insisting on it.

I realize when this happens that others may not be guided by the Golden Rule and that even if they are, they, like me, are imperfect and make mistakes.

I think this is also a good lesson to show my daughter how important philanthropy is. Many of my close friend were impacted by our friend's daughter death and it impacted us all profoundly.

Being healthy is not only not being sick, but being in shape, eating heatlhy, caring about what I am putting into my body.

I remember I was supposed to meet my trainer Thursday morning (personal fitness trainer) for a workout, but I went to bed very late and wasn't feeling very well when I woke up. So, I texted her and told her I would not be making it in. Then, I went back to bed. I slept pretty late that day (as is usual the last couple of weeks) but I don't remember exactly what time I woke up. After I woke up, I believe I did a practice exam (I am studying for an actuarial exam currently), but I can't be 100% sure. I do know that we had a cookout to go to with Josh's (my boyfriend) family. We left for the cookout around 5pm and got there at about 5:30. There was mostly mexican food - tacos, chicken, steak, guacamole, etc. We were informed once we got there that we would be going to another cookout directly after. I did not realize this, so I ate way too much. We left for the other cookout and that cookout had burgers, hotdogs, etc. We ate and then just sat and chatted for a while.After that, we came home and I think we just watched some TV or something. I imagine on Friday, we also slept pretty late - but again, I can't remember what time I woke up. The only thing I really remember from that day is that we went to Josh's aunts house for mexican food and to hang out with his parents because it was their last day in town. We had tacos and gorditos. After we hung out and chatted for a while, his parents took us out for ice cream at Baskin Robbins. I had the reeses peanut butter cup ice cream.

The second I would have to say would be living a fulfilling life and doing whatever is in their heart. Because that is truly how one may achieve happiness in the world.

Downtime is rarely a positive thing and to be constantly engaged in a task or moving in a particular direction is always progress.  When people see you always striving to meet a goal, they are more prone to open up other new possibilities for you, which in turn allows you to work even harder toward an even larger goal.  I think laziness has undone plenty of great thinkers and has subverted a lot of positive outcomes for people.  If I couldn't work constantly at one project or another, I would begin to slip into an apathetic state that would be very difficult to shake myself free from. / I also believe that honesty springs from hard work.

She waited on him to do everything. I didn't want that. I wanted friends. I wanted to be able to spend time with people other than my husband. This is where the problem starts. It's the only thing I cared about. I lost sight of the fact that I wanted real lusty type of love as well. What I found out was that I couldn't have both. So I chose friends instead of that. It bugs me. I think about it. What life would have been like had I made different choices. I guess at the end of the day though I still have my friends. Which is what I wanted. I've also learned that you have to be careful what you wish for. Now I'm trying to focus on other things I want different. For instance I don't want to be payment friendly my whole life. I'm tired of Renting my life. So I'm making a plan and getting things paid off. It will happen, Hopefully sooner than later. ","This week has been a good week. Thursday was my last work day for the week and I don't have to go back till Monday. I went to boot camp on Monday to workout and it was an exhausting workout. I felt good though. I came home and enjoyed a breakfast protein shake. Work has been a little harder with eating well because they have had a different potluck everyday this week. Thursday I went back to boot camp, but my trainer stood me up and that was rather frustrating. Saturday I was suppose to go to yoga with my friend Stacey, but she had to go to the cemetery with her family. So working out this week has been a total bust. Work has been mildly crazy. No real excitement. The person that was missing all last week finally quit so I was able to get perfect attendance for my team for the first time in a while. This is allowing my team to win the Survivor game. I fully expect to win! Friday was suppose to start my Staycation, but that isn't turning out like I expected it too. My husband was suppose to be off most of it and that didn't work out like I thought it would. On Friday he was given a bunch of claims. Good thing because it's what pays the bills, but sucky because I really wanted to get some things finished. I was able to completely get the laundry finished. Now I just need to put it away. I'll be planting a pablano plant here shortly along with a raspberry tree. Yesterday we went to Sears and bought a grill. We've got to get this put together before tomorrow for the cookout. I had dinner with my family on Friday. Now exactly what I wanted to do, but the food was pretty good and overall it was a good time. That night I had my cousin over and a friend. It was a pretty decent evening. My cousin is overcoming the loss of her fiancé. I try keep her mind off of it while she's here. It's not always an easy task, but we are making head way. They cancelled the SME program at work. This was a blow to everyone at work. Basically our floor support is now non existent. Plus is was a good program to see who would step up and be the next leaders. I've tried really hard the last few days to not be upset with my husband because he's had to work, but that's been difficult. Yesterday I watched a movie. It was awful. I believe it was called About Time. I was shocked to see that Rachel McAdams was in yet another movie about time travel. I had expected to spend the whole weekend not drinking but that didn't workout. I had drinks with friends both Friday and Saturday night. Oh well, I suppose. My husband and I decided to build a deck yesterday as an addition to our concrete porch. We are going to acid stain the concrete a darker color and do a dark wood for the addition. I think it should look rather nice. Instead of beams we are going to use a metal wire in the cross sections. I've watered my plants everyday and so far they are coming along nicely. I've already got three baby green tomatoes on my yellow cherry plant. I'm really hoping I have so many tomatoes I can't eat them all. Yesterday I went to DJ's with friends and had drinks. They are my oldest high school friends. I'm grateful that I can still say they are in my life. Today at our trip to Walmart we bought bean bags for the corn hole boards. That should be a good time tomorrow. I haven't dried my hair at all the last few days. It feels good to be a little lazy. Yesterday night my dog Max got up in the middle of the night and had to go outside. It was about 4 am in the morning. Of course when I went back to bed I couldn't sleep, so I got on Facebook and some other websites to waste some time until I fell back to sleep. I caught up on my soap operas yesterday. I'm really going to miss Sammy and EJ when they leave the show this fall. Today I'm watching Labor Day with my husband. I started it earlier but had to stop it because he stated that he'd like to watch it as well. It looks to be a much better movie than yesterday. I watched all the episodes we had of Shark Tank as well. I really hate running out of those episodes because I like them so much. Today we went to Hardees for lunch. It was disappointing. I will have to put that on my don't eat there for a while list. We finally bought batteries today. Now I realize this sounds like a simple task, but we've been transferring batteries back and forth for a while. It will be nice to stop doing this activity. I fed the cats yesterday. This morning there was either food still left in their dish or my husband beat me to it because there was food in the bowl. As I'm looking up out my window I wonder if we should stain our fence. I might suggest this later. We got a call from our lawn guy today saying that he would not be mowing today but tomorrow. This could cause a dilemma since we have a cookout tomorrow.

I also want to consume all types of art, because I think you can learn a lot from it and it really enriches your quality of life. Another big value that I have is being accepting of all types of people, and making an effort to learn about their lifestyles without being judgemental.

We all have intrinsic value and other value above and beyond that. I think a lot of people treat others unfairly, because they do not have enough empathy. They do not expend the mental effort to really try and put themselves in other's shoes. Also, they do not try to understand the experiences that others have had that form their world view. Instead of condemning others when we don't agree with them we should try to model the things we believe to be right.

844133,"My guiding values are primarily around making sure that I treat others the way that I would want to be treated. That means that I try to take care of my family and friends, but it also means that I stop to lend a hand when a stranger  needs something as well. It means in a lot of cases sacrificing something that I want or need so that other folks can get what they want or need, but I'd appreciate it if they did the same for me. I try to make sure that I don't hurt anyone either intentionally or unintentionally, though there are times where pain is going to be caused regardless. I value opportunities for new experiences and development of new skills. I also value having a bedrock of stability and security to work from so that I feel comfortable exploring new experiences and skills - not having that stability means that there's an undercurrent of fear and uncertainty which can prevent fully engaging with the experiences.","I didn't do a whole lot outside of my regular routine over the last couple days. I woke up at or before 6:30 every morning to my alarm clock - I've got one of the light alarm clocks, which attempts to gradually wake you up by having the light level in the room raise until the time you have to wake up. I have to wake up then because our diabetic cat needs to be fed and given his insulin at roughly 12 hours apart, and while I would prefer waking up around 8am, I typically need to be at work by that point. I could potentially work an off schedule which would accommodate my preferred sleep schedule, but that would mean less awake time with my wife. Anyway, after feeding and dosing Octavian, I take care of the litter boxes for all of our 6 cats, which takes roughly 20 minutes. Then I wash up and have breakfast, along with taking my vitamins and medications. Over the last 7 days, breakfast has typically been an apple and a mini blueberry bagel. Then I take a shower and get dressed. Then I drive into the office to work. I've been working over weekends, so it's been unusual for my routine to not include that. I work until lunch time (which is anywhere between 11ish and 1ish depending on who I'm having lunch with - the length of the lunch break is also dependent upon who I'm having lunch with). Then I work the rest of the afternoon - with work time interspersed with various meetings. Then I drive back to the house, have dinner with my wife, and then get back online to work.

855349,To me one of the most important values that guides me is honesty. I feel that in order to be able to really trust a person and who they are and what they say you need to believe them. It's hard not to be able to trust someone and it's also hard to be able to respect someone that lies all the time. So because of reasons such as those I choose to almost always tell the truth. The only time I do not is if it's a little white lie to one of my kids that they don't need to know the answer to anyways. I also feel that it's extremely important to once you commit to something do it. You shouldn't make promises you can't keep. If you're not sure if you're able to do something then don't say you'll be there 100% because all that does is lead to disappointment and who wants to be disappointed. I also feel that another value that guides me is compassion. I truly care for those in my life and I also care for others even if I don't know them. I feel for others who are going through a hard time or others who don't have a good support system or for those who are just less fortunate. I really feel deeply for others. I am also a very good listener and a true friend. I also think that another value that guides me is being a hard worker. I set goals and I strive to reach them. I give it my all no matter what I am doing and feel that is the only way to be. Why just go at something and only do part of the work or give it just half of yourself - if you want something you should go after it full force. I think that I also value my faith and this is sometimes something which really helps me get through the hardest of times and helps me make those difficult decisions in life when I feel no one else can help. ,The past week has been a little bit more varied than usual because we just had a day off for Memorial Day.

We did have some plans for the weekend but for the most part we had more free time than usual. Friday night my husband and my kids and I played some board games and treated ourselves to some pizza. On Saturday it was a gorgeous day and so we spent the entire day outside. The kids played while we got our lawn more ready for summer. We got our gazebo and furniture out and did some planting and weeding. So nice this time of year when things start growing. We also spent some time with our neighbors. We had a party at my sisters house and got to play some games outside because it was once again a beautiful day. I met some people I hadn't met yet and got to see a lot of my sister's friends I hadn't seen in awhile and also got to see almost all of my family which is always nice. We ate a lot of good food and just had a great time. The kids played nicely with their cousins and some neighborhood kids so we had a little more freedom than usual. We had another party yesterday at my in laws and we got to see everyone on my husbands side of the family including our new nephew who is only about 2 months old now. The kids played baseball while the adults sat out in the sun and just relaxed for a change. Then it was time to go home and get ready for work and school again. I woke up bright and early this morning and met up with a couple of my friends for a run. Although none of us were feeling all that great we managed to get a nice run in before the craziness of our days began. Then it was home to get the kids ready and for us to get ready for work.

As a recovering alcoholic, especially, this is important to me because so much of my drinking life involved lies and deceit, and just using people to get what I want.

Tuesday I planted the garden with my husband (tomato plants, etc.) and we took care of some baby birds that we found stuck in a pipe in our house. Took a cool shower and went out to eat with my husband and grocery shopped while my mom watched the girls. Wednesday I had to work at my waitressing job.

879137,"One of my most important values is honesty.  When i say something, it's very important that whoever is listening believes what I say.  To me, being dishonest to someone is basically insulting them.  I certainly don't want a reputation as someone who can not be believed because then i lose my credibility.  A person can have many flaws but if he/she is honest, it makes up for quite a few of them.  Another value I have is to make sacrifices for my family.  Family members need to rely on each other and be there for each other when needed.  I always try to keep my family in mind, and when i fail at that, i feel very bad.  Another central value is being able to have freedom in having my opinion.  Whether involving religion, politics, or any controversial topic, it's important that i'm true to my opinion.  I'm willing to change opinions if I see they need correcting, but it's equally important to be firm in my opinions regardless of what others believe, and not back down from those opinions.  Another important value is to enjoy life.  It's crucial that we get pleasure at some points in life or else we'll be consumed by work, negativity, and responsibility.  It's a question of balance; fun and work.","The first few days was time when i was on vacation, so i was basically just relaxing, spending time with my wife, listening to music, doing quite a few M-Turk surveys, and watching DVDs.

902127,"My basic values would be to be honest, show integrity and compassion to others, and to live a moral life. I do my best to teach these values to my son, and to practice them myself. I try to associate with others that live their lives in the same way. One of my biggest values is to think positive and to focus on positive energy. I follow the teachings of the Unity church, which really focuses on positive thinking, and finding the good in other people. I don't always 100% follow these guidelines, but when I do, I'm a much happier person.  / What's most important to me in my life is my family. I live my life for my husband and my son, and nothing brings me greater joy than spending time with them. I also love to spend time with my extended family, and also the friends, who are the family I have chosen. Life is too short to surround yourself with negative people, so I try to always be around positive, uplifting people. I hope to pass these principles down to my child. My husband and I do our best to not let today's society of greed, me centered, electronic world obstruct the bigger picture. We try to live simply and gratefully, and we're happier for it. We don't believe in letting our child watch tv, or play with electronics. We try to limit our own tv watching and internet usage. We go outside as often as possible, and we appreciate the beauty of nature. I like my alone time, and I don't always like being surrounded by lots of people. When I am around others, again, I try to do my best to surround myself with like minded people. Quality friendships are so much better than quantity. I've done a lot of soul searching, and I've had to remove people from my social circle who were weighing me down. ","Last week, I was on a trip to visit my family, and it was the last day. We were up in Oregon on a road trip that we split into a few days drive. That afternoon, my son and I traveled to a friend's house on the way home. We stayed overnight at her house, had dinner out at a restaurant, and then played at her house that evening. After dinner she and I had time to drink wine, relax and visit. Then my son and I continued home the next day. We spent the afternoon with my husband, and I unpacked everything from our trip. Tuesday was spent grocery shopping, errand running, and getting some quality time in with my husband. We enjoyed a romantic meal and sitting outside visiting after dinner. We went to bed and snuggled, and talked about the week we'd both had. Wednesday my husband went back to work, and I did chores around the house. I also made sure to spend time with my little one, doing our daily routine of walking the dog, playing in the park, nap time, learning time, play time, bath time, bed time. Thursday we had the usual routine, but also had a play date with friends coming over to swim in the kiddy pool. Friday was the library story time, followed by grocery shopping. Saturday was a mellow day of chores, yard work, play time, nap time, and learning time. Sunday, today, so far has been much the same as the rest of the week, but with more time spent working online during my son's nap time. I've also had time to do chores and take him and the dog on a walk. This afternoon we are going to a kid's birthday party, and hopefully going out to dinner as a family.

909696,"One of my most important values is honesty. I don't mean white lies like saying you like someone's haircut when you don't, but honesty in spirit about anything that is important. Other people do not share this value and they assume everyone else is like them, which can make it very difficult to live life as an honest person. Honesty is basically punished in our society. Of course, dishonesty is sometimes punished also. Although this is a moral value, it is also a practical value. Those who are not in the dominant group in society cannot be caught in dishonesty or we will be punished disproportionately. But if convenient members of the dominant group will assume or say I have been dishonest and there is nothing I can do about it. I have lost work due to my reputation for honesty but did it help me when I needed to pursue justice in a lawsuit -- no, it did not -- my reputation for honesty was considered irrelevant. / Another essential value is not to steal or manipulate. In Buddhist terms this is: Do not take what is not freely given. One of the most important reasons for this value (as well as for honesty) is just to make one's own life easier. One can love oneself and sleep soundly at night if one is honest and does not take from others -- I am probably one of the few people I have ever met who has been able to follow this path and I am so glad because I do experience the rewards of it directly in the ease in my life. With these values, although there is sometimes temptation, except in rare circumstances decisions are relatively easy to make. Of course, there are exceptions. One does not have to tell the truth to a psycho who is holding one captive or to people who have asked one a question that is clearly none of their business. In a contract-type arrangement one can expect the other to uphold their bargain also -- this is not a situation where the person who has previously agreed can get away with taking back their agreement.","In the past 7 days I have spent upwards of 5-8 hours a day doing MTurk tasks in order to earn pennies to cover car insurance and storage for my belongings, so I will put that up front rather than repeat it for every day. / Seven days ago through four days ago, my schedule was pretty much the same.

Of course, I don't always follow this principle - depending on the circumstances.  Some days my mood changes and I want to feel a little evil so I don't exactly follow those principles to the T.  Overall I like to think I'm a fair and balanced person- although I think everyone says this about themselves. Who knows though, in the grand scheme of things if the good outweighs the bad or vice versa.  In the end I believe it is about our intents and what actually occurs when trying to achieve these outcomes.   / For instance a bad outcome may happen to one person from the actions of another, however if the person really meant to do good then I feel like it is not an evil action.  Same goes for a good outcome that somehow occurs with mal-intent, if the intent was to cause harm then the action is still overall negative.","This past week I went on a cruise to this is dramatically different than my day to day activities.

I never liked that, especially because the people telling me what to do with myself had no idea what it was like to be me and actually live in my body.

In the afternoon, I went to 7-11 to get cigarettes and a slurpee, After I left, I got pulled over by the cops because my tags were expired. Unfortunately, I was arrested on a bench warrant I had from missing a previous court date. It was a horrible, life-changing experience. I was booked into jail and spent the night there, waiting for someone to come and rescue me. It was maddening to not be able to walk outside, or indeed even walk around as I chose. I cried myself to sleep in a little room with no air, laying on a cold metal bunk under a scratchy blanket that smelled of disinfectant. I was scared and alone, missing my children, angry at my husband, longing for my kitty to lay on my feet while I fell asleep. On Friday, my husband was able to pay my bail. When I was released, I went directly home, and it was the most beautiful place I've ever seen. I laid in my bed, hugged my children, stroked my cat, ate whatever I wanted, got high, drank beer and generally relished my freedom, not taking anything for granted.

I also volunteered at a cat shelter for this reason: helping animals is the opposite of harm, which is central to my beliefs and values.","I work as a freelance model, and I had two gigs this past week, both for figure drawing classes at an art center I work at regularly. Other than that, my week has been rather routine. My partner cannot drive, so on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays (the days he works - he is a professor) we wake up early so I can drop him off at work. After I get home, I usually play with our two cats, do a bit of cleaning, and do a few surveys on Mturk. This week I did the dishes twice. I also vacuumed and mopped. Sometimes I'll go for a walk around the block; I have a fast metabolism and have a hard time keeping weight on, but walking gives me some muscle tone so I don't look too bony. I always pick up my partner from work at 4 PM, and he makes dinner when we get home. A few times this week, I've made cocktails for us. I made some very nice banana daiquiries last night.

970198,"My guiding values when I was a kid were a very confused mishmash of nothings and sensations of guilt and vague religiousity. I felt very controlled by my parents and tried as best I could just to cultivate something of an independent identity. Eventually I encountered the music of Rage Against the Machine and found my way into politics and Noam Chomsky. So for a while my values were expressed in terms of a political understanding, of sympathizing with oppressed people and being skeptical of the government and authority figures generally. Shortly after this I encountered the work of Ayn Rand and objectivism. This was a profound influence on me, and lead me to embrace the importance of objective knowledge, of reason, of individuality, of self-esteem. At a similar time I read George Orwell's 1984. And, I may have been very unique in this, but I read Ayn Rand as a rather natural extension of Noam Chomsky and George Orwell- suspicion of a controlling authoritarian state. I never met any objectivist or conservative who agreed with my views on these subjects. /  / In college I traded this in, feeling Objectivism was too narcisstic. I exchanged Ayn Rand for analytic philosophy, and for philosophy of science, and for a form of moral realism that locals moral value in the natural world. Also I combined this with a kind of wonder and fascination toward nature and toward science, and found Richard Feynman and Carl Sagan to be profound influences. Today I think of my values largely in terms of the fact that they can be navigated via logic and reason, and that even the deepest spiritual experiences, though authentic and real, can be understood without resort to religious or overly philosophical explanation. The biochemistry of my brain gives rise to experiences of wonder and beauty, and that is okay. /  / Post college, I have tried to become more empathetic and forgiving. To learn to ""go with the flow"" to support people, and to learn to build relationships over the medium and long term. To realize that I need to be supportive, that other people matter just as much as me, and that I should be proactive and work to shape moments in other peoples lives in a beneficial way.

This might be perceived as a selfless act, but in all actuality, it is not.
